# vanilla-char-rnn
A tensorflow implementation of a character level rnn model for generating text data

### inspiration drawn from-
[karpathy-char-rnn](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086)  
[Understanding LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

### next steps-
1. Implement the fully availible model [here](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn)
1. Work on other architecture like LSTM,GRU etc.
1. Get a talking eminem head to move its mouth while the lyrics are generated. :P  
1.Add GPU support and checkout if the word2vec method of embeddings works out better
