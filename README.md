# Char-rnn
A tensorflow implementation of a character level rnn model for generating text data

### inspiration drawn from-
[karpathy-char-rnn](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086)  
[Understanding LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

### next steps-
<s>1. Implement the fully availible model [here](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).</s>  
<s>2. Work on other architecture like LSTM,GRU etc.</s>  
<s>3. Upload the checkpoint files for the fully trained model. (it requires more than 2 days, but will try to do it soon)</s>  
<s>4. Changed the objective to generating rick and morty scripts. (will add data in the next commit)</s>  
5. Convert ipython notebook to python scripts.  
6. Host the trained models on a webpage. (side note, create a blog)
