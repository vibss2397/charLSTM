Morty, you got to... come on.

- You got to come with me.

- Rick, what's going on?

I got a surprise for you, Morty.

It's the middle of the night.

What are you talking about?

I got a surprise for you.

Ow!

Ow! You're tugging me too hard.

I got a surprise for you, Morty.

What do you think

of this flying vehicle, Morty?

I built it out of stuff I found

in the garage.

Yeah, Rick, it's great.

- Is this the surprise?

- Morty, I had to...

I had to... I had to...

I had to make a bomb, Morty.

- I had to create a bomb.

- What?! A bomb?!

We're gonna drop it down there just

get a whole fresh start, Morty.

- Create a whole fresh start.

- T-t-that's absolutely crazy!

Come on, Morty.

Just take it easy, Morty.

It's gonna be good.

Right now, we're gonna go pick

up your little friend Jessica.

Jessica?

From my math class?

When I drop the bomb...

you know, I want you to

have somebody, you know I

want you to have the thing

I'm gonna make it like a new Adam

and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.

And Jessica's gonna be Eve,

and so that's the surprise, Morty.

No, you can't!

Jessica doesn't

even know I exist.

But but forget about that,

because you can't

blow up humanity.

I-I get what you're

trying to say, Morty.

Listen, I'm not you

don't you don't got to worry about me...

trying to fool around with with Jessica

or mess around with Jessica or anything.

I'm I'm not that

kind of guy, Morty.

What are you talking

about, Rick?

You you don't have to worry about

me getting with Jessica or anything.

She she she she...

she's all for you, Morty.

I don't care about Jessica!

You know what, Morty?

You're right.

Let's forget the girl all

together.

She she's probably nothing

but trouble, anyways.

<i>Arming neutrino bomb.</i>

That's it that's it, Rick.

I'm taking the wheel.

Get off of me, Morty!

I'm taking charge of

this situation, buddy.

What's gotten into you?

I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand

around like some sort of dumb...

What are you, crazy?

...person and just

let you blow up the whole world.

All right, all right.

I'll I'll land.

I'll land. I'll land.

I'll land the thing.

Big tough guy all of a sudden.

We'll park it right here, Morty.

Right here on the side

of the road here.

Oh, thank God.

You know what?

That was all a test, Morty.

Just an elaborate test to make

you more assertive.

It was?

Sure. Why not?

I don't know.

You you know what, mo-

<i>Neutrino bomb armed.</i>

Um...

I see there's a new episode of

that singing show tonight.

Who do you guys think is gonna

be the best singer?

Oh, my God.

His head is in his food.

- I'm going to puke.

- Morty, are you getting sick?

I told you not to practice-kiss

the living-room pillow.

The dog sleeps on it.

I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom.

I just I didn't get a lot of

sleep last night.

Maybe my dreams were just too

loud or something.

Or maybe you were out all night

again with grandpa Rick.

- What?!

- Dad?

What, so everyone's supposed to

sleep every single night now?

You realize that nighttime makes

up half of all time?

Damn it!

- Jerry!

- Beth!

Oh, my God.

My parents are so loud.

I want to die.

Mm, there is no God, summer. You

got to rip that band-aid off now.

You'll thank me later.

Okay, with all due respect, Rick...

What am I talking about?

What respect is due?

How is my son supposed to pass

his classes if you keep dragging him off

for high-concept

Sci-Fi rigamarole?

Listen, Jerry, I don't want to

overstep my bounds or anything.

It's your house.

It's your world.

You're a real Julius Caesar.

But I'll tell you some tell you how

how I feel about school, Jerry.

It's a waste of time a bunch of people

running around, bumping into each other.

G-guy up front says,

"two plus two."

The people in the

back say, "four."

Then the bell rings, and they

give you a carton of milk

and a piece of paper that says you

can go take a dump or something.

I mean, it's it's not a place

for smart people, Jerry.

And I know that's not

a popular opinion,

but it's my two

cents on the issue.

This was a good breakfast, Beth.

You really made the

crap out of those eggs.

I wish your mother was

here to eat them.

Oh, dad.

What? For real?

All right, now,

everybody get settled.

Get away from the windows!

Now, look, we're gonna be dealing

with some real serious stuff today.

You might have heard of it.

It's called math.

And without it, none of us would

even exist, so let's jump right in.

- Two plus two.

- Jessica.

Five plus five.

Tenssica.

Okay, good.

It's time for the quiz.

Yeah, you know what?!

Aw, too bad!

Tough!

First row, take one.

Pass it back for me.

<i>The stakes are

high in this room.</i>

<i>There's crucial things happening

here every day.</i>

<i>People getting smarter.

Some of y'all getting dumber.</i>

<i>Some of y'all ain't

gonna see 3:00.</i>

<i>Hi, Morty.</i>

Whoa!

Hi, Jessica.

Can I show these to you?

Wow.

Th-they're both great.

Thank you.

You know what I named these?

My little morties.

Uh, that's

flattering... and a little weird.

Do you know what I want you

to do with them?

Rename them?

Squeeze them.

Manhandle them.

Give them the business.

See if you can shuffle them.

I mean, really get in there and

knock them around.

- No wrong answers.

- Wow.

Well, okay, Jessica.

L-let's give this a shot.

Mm.

Oh, Morty.

What are you doing to me?

Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.

Morty!

What are you doing to me?!

Jessica.

Morty!

Jessica.

Five more minutes of this,

and I'm gonna get mad.

Je-Jessica.

Jessica.

Not my fault this is happening.

Well, well, well.

- Uh, morning, Frank.

- "Morning"?

What was what is that

supposed to mean?

You making fun of me?

Are you trying to say my

family's poor?

Oh, geez, Frank.

I don't know if a knife is

necessary.

I mean, you know, y-you kind of

had things handled without it.

You telling me how to bully now?

Big mistake, Morty.

And now I'm gonna cut you,

'cause my family's rich.

There you are, Morty.

Listen to me.

I got an errand to run in a

whole different dimension.

I need an extra pair of hands.

Oh, geez, Rick.

What'd you do to Frank?

It's pretty obvious, Morty.

I froze him.

Now listen I need

your help, Morty.

I mean, we got we got to get get the hell

out of here and go take care of business.

- It's important. Come on, Morty.

- I don't know, Rick.

I can't leave school again.

Do you have any concept of how much

higher the stakes get out there, Morty?

What do you think I can just

do it all by myself?

Come on!

Aw, geez. Okay.

I guess I can skip history.

What about Frank?

I mean, shouldn't

you unfreeze him?

I'll do it later, Morty.

He'll be fine.

Let's go.

<i>Oh, my God. I'm about to

walk past Frank Palicky.</i>

<i>This is the story we'll be

telling our children.</i>

Hi, Frank.

Aah!

- Scalpel.

- Scalpel.

Knock, knock.

Jerry?

My manager gave me an

hour for lunch, and I thought,

"hey, why not swing by where

your wife works?"

We're losing him.

Okay, he's back.

Jerry, please tell me you're here

for an incredibly urgent reason.

Well, it's lunch.

I mean, it's one of three meals

that have existed for millennia.

Losing him.

Stabilized.

Okay, I only ask, Jerry,

because, as you know,

my job involves

performing heart surgery.

- Well, yeah, on horses.

- Excuse me?

Okay.

Let's not rehash that fight.

I sense that you're busy and

will now be on my way.

Whoa!

What is this on the floor?

Some kind of literature for a

really nice-looking nursing home.

Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch

let's put your dad here.

Let's put your dad

in a nursing home.

We're losing him.

Hey, Tom.

We know when we're losing him.

We can hear the beeps!

There she is.

All right. Come on, Morty.

Let's go.

Oh, geez. Okay.

Oh, man, Rick.

What is this place?

It's dimension 35c,

and it's got the perfect

climate conditions

for a special type

of tree, Morty, called a mega tree,

and there's fruit in those trees,

and there's seeds in those fruits.

I'm talking about mega seeds.

They're they're

incredibly powerful,

and I need them to help me

with my research, Morty.

Oh, man, Rick.

I'm looking around this place,

and I'm starting to work up some

anxiety about this whole thing.

All right. All right.

Calm down. Listen to me, Morty.

I know that new situations can

be intimidating.

You're looking around,

and it's all scary and different,

but, you know,

m-meeting them head on,

charging right into them like a

bull that's how we grow as people.

I'm no stranger to

scary situations.

I deal with them all the time.

Now, if you just stick with me,

Morty, we're gonna be holy

crap, Morty, run!

I never seen that thing

before in my life.

I don't even know

what the hell it is!

We got to get out of here,

Morty!

It's gonna kill us!

We're gonna die!

We're gonna die, Morty!

Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

Breathe that breathe that

fresh air in, Morty.

Y-you smell that?

That's the smell of

adventure, Morty.

That's that's the smell of

of of of a whole different

evolutionary timeline.

All right, Rick, look how

much longer is this gonna be?

Shouldn't I be back

at school by now?

Are you joking me?

I mean, look at all the crazy

crap surrounding us.

Look at that thing right there.

What the hell is that thing?

You think you're gonna see that

kind of thing at school?

Look at it just

lumbering around.

It defies all logic that thing.

Yeah, Rick, I get it.

We're surrounded by monsters.

That's kind of the reason

why I want to leave.

Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

Morty, you see this?

You see what we just

stumbled upon, Morty?

Any idea what that

is down there?

The mega trees?

That's right, Morty the mega trees

with the mega fruit on them.

And that's what I'm talking

about, Morty.

That's where my seeds are.

If we would have done

what you wanted,

I would have never

have found them,

because you're

so in love with school.

All right, all right.

So, what's so special about

these seeds, anyways?

You ask a lot of

questions, Morty.

Not very charismatic.

It makes you kind of an

Under underfoot figure.

Just take these shoes, Morty.

They're special grappling shoes.

When you're wearing these

things, these babies,

you can basically just walk on

any surface you want, Morty

up, down, below, turn around to

the left.

These things really bring it all

together.

Aah!

You have to turn them on, Morty!

The shoes have to be turned on!

I am not putting my

father in a home!

He just came back into my life,

and you want to grab him

and stuff him

under a mattress like last

month's Victoria's secret?

I told you I was ordering you

something for Valentine's day.

More importantly, your father is

a horrible influence on our son.

Everything cool in here, Beth?

- It's fine, Davin.

- Okay, cool.

You know, we did

something great today.

There's nothing more noble and

free than the heart of a horse.

Since we're fighting, if you ever

have an affair with that guy,

I will come to the hotel room and blow my

brains out all over your naked bodies.

Look, I appreciate the

stress you're under, but...

Morty was having trouble in school

way before my dad moved in,

and the only influence I

can see Rick having...

is that, for the first time in

his life, Morty has a friend.

Well, maybe you're right.

Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

I'm my father's daughter.

I'm smart.

Why do you think I'm

a heart surgeon?

Horse heart surgeon.

Hello?

Mrs. Smith?

This is principal Vagina,

no relation.

I wonder if you and Morty's

father might be able

to have a chat

with me this afternoon?

Morty, oh, you really d-did a

number on your legs right now.

You know, you got to turn the shoes

on, Morty, for them to work.

Yeah, look I turned mine on.

I had no problem getting down here.

It was a leisurely breeze.

I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.

Yeah, I can see that.

But do you think you'll still be able

to help me collect my seeds, Morty?

Are you kidding me?!

That's it, Rick!

That's the last straw!

I can't believe this!

I'm sitting here with

both of my legs broken,

and you're still asking me

about getting those seeds?!

Ooh! Ow! Oh!

Y-y-you're a monster.

Y-you're like Hitler, but

but even Hitler cared about

Germany or something.

Okay, hold on just a

second, Morty.

Ooh.

Ohh.

Ooh.

Wow, Rick.

That stuff just healed my broken

legs instantly.

I mean, I've never felt

so good in my life.

Thank you.

Don't worry about it, Morty.

Just come help me get these

seeds, all right, buddy?

Sure thing, Rick.

Not that you asked,

Morty, but what just

happened there is...

I went into a future dimension with

such advanced medicine...

that they had broken-leg serum at

every corner drugstore.

The stuff was all over the

place, Morty.

Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

There's just one problem,

Morty one little hang-up.

The dimension I visited was so

advanced, they had also halted

the aging process, and everyone

there was young, Morty, and they

had been forever.

I was the only old

person there, Morty.

It was like I was some sort of, you

know, celebrity, walking around.

I-I was fascinating to them.

There were a lot of attractive

women there, Morty,

and they they they they

all wanted time with me.

I had a lot of fun with

a lot of young ladies,

but I spent so much time there,

my interdimensional portal device

it's got no charge left, Morty.

- It's got no charge left.

- What?!

It's as good as garbage, Morty.

It's not gonna work

anymore, Morty.

Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

W-what are we gonna do?

I-I have to be back at school

right now.

How are we gonna get back home?

There's ways to get

back home, Morty.

It's just it's just gonna be

a little bit of a hassle.

We're gonna have to go through

interdimensional customs,

so you're gonna have

to do me a real solid.

Uh-oh.

When we get to customs,

I'm gonna need you to take

these seeds into the bathroom,

and I'm gonna need you to put them

way up inside your butthole, Morty.

In my butt?

Put them way up inside there,

as far as they can fit.

Oh, geez, Rick.

I really don't want

to have to do that.

Well, somebody's got to

do it, Morty.

Th-these seeds aren't gonna get

through customs unless they're

in someone's rectum, Morty.

And they'll fall right

out of mine.

I've done this too

many times, Morty.

I mean, you're young.

You've got your whole

life ahead of you,

and your anal cavity is

still taut, yet malleable.

You got to do it for grandpa,

Morty.

Y-you've got to put these seeds

inside your butt.

- In my butt?

- Come on, Morty.

Please, Morty.

You have to do it, Morty.

Oh, man.

The fact is, your son, Morty,

has attended this school for a

total of seven hours over the

last two months.

What?

Why didn't you notify us?

I done been notifying you.

Have you not been getting the

messages I've been leaving with

Morty's grandfather?

Boom!

Told you! In your face!

He is ruining our child!

Wait, what am I celebrating?

Yeah, see, I thought

something was fishy there,

because it's usually

Morty's grandpa

that's taking him out of school.

Summer?

What kind

of God lets this happen?

We had a little incident.

A student was frozen to death.

And there's no evidence that a

Latino student did it!

Everyone wants to take this

to a racial place.

I won't let them.

<i>The glarp zone is for

flarping and unglarping only.</i>

So, I told him, "give me the

blimfarx," you know?

This this guy he doesn't

understand interstellar currency.

It's, like, I'm trying to eat

a flimflam like, that's what

we eat on girvonesk.

<i>The glarp zone is for

flarping and unglarping only.</i>

I don't like it here, Morty.

I can't abide bureaucracy.

I don't like being told where to

go and what to do.

I consider it a violation.

Did you get those seeds all the

way up your butt?

Yeah, Rick.

Let's just get this

over with, okay?

I mean, these things are pointy.

They hurt.

That means they're good ones.

You're a good kid, Morty.

Those mega seeds are super

valuable to my work.

You've been a huge help to me.

I'm gonna be able to do

all kind of things with them.

It's gonna be great, Morty.

All kinds of science.

Okay, next through.

Except you. You go over there.

Why does he have to go

over there?

Random check.

He's got to go through

the new machine.

What new machine?

It's a new machine.

It detects stuff all the way up

your butt.

Run, Morty! Run!

Aah!

Red alert!

Ohhhhh!

Hey! Ohhhhhh.

Aah!

Don't think about it!

Ooh!

Oh, nice, Morty!

The student becomes the teacher.

Whoooooo!

Aah!

Aw, hell, no, dawg.

You know me I'm just trying to-

Aah!

I need to type in the coordinates

to our home world, Morty.

- Cover me.

- Oh, man.

I mean, you know, I-I don't want

to shoot nobody.

They're just robots, Morty!

It's okay to shoot them!

They're robots!

Aah!

My leg is shot off!

Glenn's bleeding to death!

Someone call his

wife and children!

They're not robots, Rick!

It's a figure of speech, Morty.

They're bureaucrats.

I don't respect them.

Just keep shooting, Morty.

You have no idea what prison

is like here!

Holy crap!

This is insane!

Come on, Morty!

We got to get the

hell out of here!

Wow.

Did you just come into the

cafeteria through a portal?

Uh, yeah.

Well, you know, my my

Ferrari's in the shop.

Just kidding.

- You're Morty, right?

- Yeah.

You can get his number later.

Come on, Morty.

We got to get out of here.

You got to get those seeds out

of your ass.

Oh, look, honey. It's our

son with Albert Ein-douche.

What?

I'm an angry father,

not an improvisor.

Oh, hi, Jerry.

Oh, my goodness, Morty!

What are you doing out of class?

We talked about this.

Your your parents and I are very

disappointed in in this behavior.

No? No takers?

You guys should really not be

touching that stuff.

- It's beyond your reasoning.

- You're beyond our reasoning!

Takes one to know one.

Dad, how could you make

my son miss an entire

semester of school?

I mean, it's not like he's a hot

girl.

He can't just bail on his life and

set up shop in someone else's.

What what are you

guys doing with my stuff?

We're moving you... to a

nursing home.

A nursing home?

What are what are you, nuts?

I'm a genius.

I build robots for fun.

Well, now you can

build baskets and watch

Paul Newman movies on VHS...

and mentally scar the boy scouts

every Christmas.

- What does that mean?

- It's personal.

Dad, mom, come on.

Rick just needed my help is all.

Morty, stay out of this.

You are obviously not capable of

judging these

situations on your own.

What are you trying to

say about Morty?

That he's stupid or something?

Oh, don't high-road us, dad.

You know fully well that Morty

is the last child that needs to

be missing classes.

I-I-I don't know what

you mean by that.

Can can can you be a

little bit more specific?

Oh, for crying out he's got some

kind of disability or something.

Is that what you want us to say?

I do?

Well, duh doy, son.

Look, I love you, Morty, but...

we both know you're not as

fast as the other kids,

and if you want

to compete in this world,

you got to work twice as hard.

Aw, geez, dad.

Y-you know, that's a lot to drop

on a kid all at once.

Morty, t-tell your

parents the square root of pi.

Oh, come on, Rick.

You know I can't.

The square root of pi, Morty.

Go!

1.77245385.

Whoa!

What the hell?

Holy crap. He's right.

Morty, tell your parents the

first law of Thermodynamics.

"The increment in the

internal energy of a system is...

equal to the increment of heat

supplied to the system."

Wow! I'm so smart!

But I told the both of

you school is stupid.

It's not how you learn things.

Morty's a gifted child.

He has a special mind.

That's why he's

my little helper.

He's like me.

He's gonna be doing great

science stuff later in his life.

He's too smart for school.

He needs to keep hanging out

and helping me.

Jerry, I don't want whatever's

happening here to stop.

No, I-I understand.

Uh, maybe we overreacted.

But he has to keep

going to school.

Okay, Jerry.

You drive a hard bargain, but

what am I supposed to do?

Say no?

You you really wear the pants

around here.

I just want you to know,

between us, from now on,

it's gonna be

100% honesty and open,

clear communication.

Frank Palicky was

frozen to death today!

No idea what you're

talking about.

Okay.

Well, uh, Morty, it's your

bedtime in an hour.

Don't stay up all night again.

This is good, though.

This can work.

I think we can be a family.

And now, Beth, if you'll have me,

I would love to have you.

You know what?

Okay.

Holy cow, Rick.

I didn't know hanging out with

you was making me smarter.

Full disclosure, Morty it's not.

Temporary superintelligence is

just a side effect of the mega

seeds dissolving in

your rectal cavity.

Aw, man.

Yeah, and once those

seeds wear off,

you're gonna lose most

of your motor skills,

and you're also gonna lose

a significant amount of

brain functionality for 72

hours, Morty.

Starting right about now.

Ohh, man.

Oh, geez! Ohh.

I'm sorry, Morty.

It's a bummer.

In reality, you're as

dumb as they come.

And I needed those seeds real bad,

and I had to give them up

just to get your

parents off my back,

so now we're gonna

have to go get more.

And then we're gonna go on even

more adventures after that, Morty.

And you're gonna keep your mouth

shut about it, Morty,

because the world is full of idiots that

don't understand

what's important, and they'll

tear us apart, Morty.

But if you stick with me, I'm gonna

accomplish great things, Morty,

and you're gonna

be part of them,

and together, we're gonna

run around, Morty.

We're gonna do all kinds of

wonderful things, Morty.

Just you and me, Morty.

The outside world is

our enemy, Morty.

We're the only friends

we've got, Morty.

It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and

Morty and their adventures, Morty.

Rick and Morty

forever and forever.

100 years, Rick and

Morty's things.

Me and Rick and Morty running

around, and Rick and Morty time.

All day long, forever.

All a hundred days.

Rick and Morty

forever 100 times.

What?

Why are you looking at me?

You want to go outside?

Outside?

Outside?

Are you kidding me?!

- Come on!

- Oh, my God.

- What's wrong?

- Your idiot dog!

Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad.

Did you, snuffles?

You're a good boy.

Don't praise him now, Morty!

He just peed on the carpet!

Bad dog! Bad!

Morty, come on.

I need your help tonight.

Hey, wait, hold on

a second, Rick.

You wouldn't by any chance have

some sort of crazy science thing

you could whip up that

might help make this dog

a little smarter, would you?

I thought the whole point of having

a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.

If I were you, I wouldn't pull

that thread.

Come on, Morty.

Listen, Rick,

if you're gonna stay here rent-free

and use my son for

your stupid science,

the least you could do is put a little

bit of it to use for the family.

You make that dog smart or...

Morty's grounded!

- Ha-ha!

- Aw, man!

Boy, you really got me up against

a wall this time, Jerry.

All right, ruffles...

What's his name?

Snuffles.

Snuffles, shake.

Roll over.

Go to the bathroom.

- Holy crap!

- No way.

Yeah, you're at the top

of your game now, Jerry.

Have fun.

Come on, Morty.

- That was fantastic, Rick!

- Yeah, Morty, if you like that,

boy, you're you're really going

to flip your lid over this one.

W-w-w-what is it?

It's a device, Morty,

that when you put it in your ear,

you can enter people's

dreams, Morty.

It's just like that movie that

you keep crowing about.

- You talking about "Inception"?

- That's right, Morty.

This is gonna be

a lot like that,

except, you know, it's

gonna maybe make sense.

"Inception" made sense.

You don't have to try

to impress me, Morty.

Listen, tonight we're gonna go

into the home of your math teacher,

Mr. Goldenfold, and

we're gonna incept the idea

in his brain to give you

A's in math, Morty.

That way you can, you know,

y-you're gonna help me with my

science, Morty, all the time.

Geez, Rick, in the

time it took you to make this

thing, couldn't you have just,

you know, helped me with my

homework?

Are you listening to me, Morty?

Homework is stupid.

The whole point is

to get less of it.

Come on, let's just get

over there and deal with this thing.

W-we're gonna incept your

teacher.

You're frustrating me.

<i>You don't know me!</i>

<i>Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.</i>

<i>Next week on "The days and

nights of Mrs. Pancakes"...</i>

<i>You don't know me!</i>

<i>Then let me get to know yo,

damn it!</i>

Uh-oh! Spoilers!

I'm a full season behind.

Wow, Rick, I can't

believe we're sitting around,

standing around in

Mr. Goldenfold's house.

It's really weird.

It's about to get a

whole lot weirder, Morty.

Wheat thins. Wheat thins.

I'll take two.

Oh, I think you've had

enough, sir.

You don't know me.

All right, Morty,

time to make our move.

Make it bounce.

No, you didn't.

Oh, jiggle it now.

You better stop with that.

Allahu akbar!

We're gonna take

control of this plane!

We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith

gets better grades in math!

Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

The name's not buddy.

It's Goldenfold.

Nice to wheat you!

Take cover, Morty!

Ooh!

Goldenfold's got more

control here than I anticipated.

I mean, the guy teaches

high-school math.

I didn't take him for an

active dreamer.

We got to take him out so he

wakes up, Morty.

But we can't get killed.

If you get killed in someone else's

dream, you die for real, Morty.

What?!

Are you kidding me?!

Ohhhhhh!

Don't be a baby!

You avoid getting shot in real

life all the time, Morty.

Just do the same thing here, and

we'll be fine!

Now bring me my slippers.

Now, be my footstool, snuffles.

This is what I'm talking about.

- This is a dog.

- Oh, yeah.

This should play out just fine.

You said the same thing,

equally sarcastically,

at our wedding and guess what.

Oh, my God.

He's trying to tell us

something.

That is so awesome.

Aw, he's saying

"I love lasagna".

He's saying "I love Obama".

So cute!

I'm posting this online, like,

right now.

I should call Bob Saget.

Is that still a thing?

Hmm?

Goldenfold, we're coming out!

We just want to talk!

Why would I negotiate with you?

Because we're both rational adults

that don't want

anything bad to happen.

And because I have a human shield.

Mrs. Pancakes!

Oh, no, Morty.

His subconscious is panicking.

Run!

Relax, Morty.

Look!

Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

Come on!

Hey, you don't know me!

Oh, no, Rick, look!

Goldenfold landed the plane,

and he's created a mechanical

arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out

of the air while he lets us fall

- into a giant vat of lava!

- Pretty concise, Morty.

Looks like we've merely

prolonged the inevitable.

That's it, Morty!

Prolonging the inevitable!

Listen, if we go into

Mrs. Pancakes' dream,

everything will go 100

times slower, Morty.

That'll buy us some time to

figure this out!

You don't know m-

All right, let's go.

Oh, man, Rick, this is

pretty weird.

Don't judge, Morty.

Okay.

All right, well...

Look, Mrs. Pancakes is

right over there.

I'll just go ask her to tell

goldenfold not to kill us when

she wakes up.

Whoa, whoa, Morty, the

trick to incepting is making

people think they came up with

the idea.

Listen to me.

If we're gonna incept

Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend.

I'll talk to you after lunch.

Ooh, hey!

Ooh, oh!

Oh, man.

Come and join us.

I'm sorry. No, no.

- Ooh, come here!

- No, thanks!

Ooh, wow!

- Come over here, baby!

- No, I'm okay.

Whoa!

Summer?!

Hey, there, stranger.

What do you think

of these things?

Ohh! Oh! Gross!

Gross!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

What's the matter with you,

Morty?

Calm down!

You're kind of killing the vibe

in here.

It's Summer!

Aw, geez.

Looks like goldenfold has some

predilections so shameful he

buries them in the dreams of the

people in his dreams,

including a pervy attraction

to your underage sister.

Can you blame him?

Come on, old man, little boy.

Let's make an inter-generational

sandwich.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

Put some clothes on, for Pete's

sake!

This is disgusting!

- I'm gonna puke!

- I can't take it, Rick!

Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure

chamber are punishable by death!

Off with their heads!

Time to go another

dream deep, Morty!

What the hell?

Why would Mr. goldenfold's dream

version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream

version of a centaur be dreaming

about a scary place like this, Rick?

Geez, I don't know, Morty.

Wha-what do you want from me?

Welcome to your

nightmare, bitch!

- Oh, here we go!

- Holy crap!

Looks like some sort of

legally safe knock-off of an

'80s horror character with

miniature swords for fingers

instead of knives.

I'm scary Terry.

You can run, but you

can't hide, bitch!

Whoa! Hey, buddy.

What you got going on there?

Snuffles fix.

Make better.

Humans understand snuffles now?

That... is... awesome!

Snuffles want to be understood.

Snuffles need to be understood.

Okay, yeah.

I get what Beth was

talking about.

Fun's over.

Whoa, dad, you can't,

like, endow a creature

with sentience and

then rip it away.

- Why not?

- I don't know.

It's Indian giving.

<i>A sophisticated predator,</i>

<i>nature's perfect killing</i>

<i>machine, the vicious wolf</i>

<i>stalks its prey with purpose

and skill.</i>

<i>It was only with years of</i>

<i>selective breeding

and genetic altering</i>

<i>that this noble beast

was transformed into man's</i>

<i>subservient little buddy.</i>

Aw! Oh, my God!

He recognizes the other dogs on TV.

<i>"A," "b"</i>

<i>his name is scary Terry</i>

<i>"C," "d"</i>

<i>he's very scary</i>

Holy crap!

We have to escape into

someone else's dreams, Morty!

Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

<i>"E," "f"</i>

he'll design your death

The little girl!

Huh?

"J," "k," he'll really ruin

your day

Are you kidding me?

This again?

Oh, man, it looks like we've

hit dream bedrock here, Morty.

Oh, geez, Rick.

W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

Nothing but fear from here on

out, bitch!

Ohhhh!

Holy crap, Morty.

He can travel through dreams.

He can travel through dreams!

We're so screwed!

Where are my testicles, Summer?

Where are my testicles, Summer?

They were removed.

Where have they gone?

Oh, wow.

That's an intense line of

questioning, snuffles.

Do not call me that!

"Snuffles" was my slave name.

You shall now call me snowball,

because my fur is pretty and white.

Okay, snowball, just

calm down, okay?

You're scaring me.

Scaring you?

Tell me, Summer, if a human was

born with stumpy legs, would

they breed it with another

deformed human and put their

children on display like the

dachshund?

Uhhh...

Hey.

Oh, wow.

Okay, is is is everything

okay in here?

Jerry, come to rub my face in

urine again?

No!

No, we were... uh, just seeing if

Summer wanted to... uh...

Go on, um, one of our

famous midnight family walks!

Yeah. Totally.

Let's go.

You will walk when it is time

to walk.

What are we here for again?

Incepting?

We're trying to incept

me to get an "A" in math?

Oh, yeah.

Buckle up, bitch!

Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot!

You can run, but you

can't hide, bitch!

Hold on, Morty.

Y-you know what?

He keeps saying we can run but

we can hide.

- I say we try hiding.

- But that's the opposite of what-

Yeah, well, since when are we taking

this guy's advice on anything?

Hey, you know what?

You got a really good

point there, Rick.

Like, if the truth was that we

could hide, it's not like he'd

be sharing that information with

us, you know?

I-I-I think it's a

good idea, Rick.

Worst-case scenario

we're back to running.

Wow, you know what?

I mean, it looks like we could

have just hid this whole time.

Boy, Rick, that was

some good thinking.

Thanks, Morty.

Yeah, it's nice to be on the

same page every once in a while.

You can run...

But you can't hide!

Oh, this is perfect, Morty.

Look at that.

He's getting sleepy.

Just a little bit longer before

he calls it a day.

That's when we make our move.

Snuffles, we didn't

mean you any harm!

This is a huge misunderstanding.

Dad, he wants to be

called snowball.

Well, I'm not calling him that.

That's ridiculous.

You're being very aggressive,

Jerry.

Perhaps tomorrow Dr. scraps will solve

that problem with a bit of surgery.

You think you can control me

with a haircut?

Hi, honey. You're home early.

- How was your day?

- I don't want to talk about it!

Oh, of course.

- You never want to talk about it.

- Get off my back, bitch!

Out there. Not in here.

Yeah, I know, I know.

I shouldn't take my anger out

on you or scary Brandon.

I love you, Melissa.

I love you, too, Terry.

Morty, this is perfect.

After a little scary coitus,

they should be fast asleep and

then we'll incept him.

Looks like scary Terry's

having a nightmare.

Oh, boy, Rick.

I can only imagine what horrible

things must, you know...

...scare scary Terry.

Oh, no!

I'm late to class, bitch!

Oh, no!

I'm not wearing any pants!

Ah, well, Mr. Terry,

why don't you tell the whole class

the proper wordplay to use when

one is chasing one's victim

through a pumpkin patch?

Oh... um...

"Bitch."

Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think

of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch?

Hey, leave him alone!

Yeah, this is a bunch

of bullcrap.

Who cares what stupid pun you

make when you kill someone?

Why don't you let the poor guy

say whatever he wants?

Well, I never!

I-I see no reason to stand here

and take this.

You're putting too much pressure

on yourself, scary Terry.

You know, I mean, y-you're

perfectly scary enough as it is.

Hey, yo, scary T.,

don't even trip about your

pants... dawg.

Here's a pair on us, fool.

Aww, bitch.

I don't know what to say.

You don't need to say anything.

We got you, dawg.

You're our boy, dawg.

Don't even trip.

Oh, hey, it's you guys!

I haven't seen him this

relaxed in years.

If you guys ever need

anything, just say the word.

As a matter of fact, Terry, there is

something you could help us with.

"Q," "r," you won't get very far

I always hated that song!

These halves don't belong

together, bitch!

Sex is sacred!

This is because you don't give

Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

Holy crap! God damn!

I know one thing for sure...

I'm giving Morty an "A" in math,

and that's my idea.

That is an original thought.

What the hell?

Out of the frying pan

dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?

Oh, man, what's going on?

Well, it's possible

that your dog became self-aware

and made modifications on the

cognition amplifier, then turned

on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after

learning about humanity's cruel

subjugation of his species,

but your guess is as

good as mine, Morty.

I can't believe how mean snuffles

got just because he's smart.

This is why I choose to get C's.

Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

- Dad!

- Rick!

- Oh, thank God, Morty.

- Oh, you're welcome.

All right, let's get

out of here.

If we hurry we can set

up camp in a sewer tunnel

or something before the dogs

completely take over.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

We're not going anywhere.

This is my house.

I'm not abandoning it.

It's all over, Jerry.

The dogs are on a path to total

world domination.

But, hey, at least they know not

to piss on your carpet, right?

Wait a minute.

I have an idea.

Gentlemen, a moment

of your time.

See that?

I'm peeing all over

your special guns.

That means I own them.

Bad person. Bad.

Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

Bring the boy to me.

You were always kind to me,

Morty.

That's why I will leave you with

your testicles.

From now on, you will be my best

friend and live by my side.

Th-thanks, snuffles.

Begin phase two.

<i>Fighting continues as the dog army

captures the eastern seaboard.</i>

<i>It appears clear at this time...</i>

<i>that the era of human superiority

has come to a bitter end.</i>

Please! Please don't kill me!

What's she saying, bill?

I think she's saying,

"I love lasagna."

Mmm.

Thank you, Fido.

Rick!

I thought you were dead!

No, no, no, I was just

playing dead.

Good news, though, Morty.

This whole thing's gonna be over

really soon.

- What?

- It's a dream, Morty.

We're in your dog's dream.

The night the dogs captured us,

after you cried and crapped your pants,

we all went to sleep.

Then I used my dream inceptors to put

the two of us inside snuffles' dream.

But I-it's been like a

whole year!

It's been six hours.

Dreams move one one-hundredth

the speed of reality, and dog time

is one-seventh human time.

So, you know, every day here is

like a minute.

It's like "Inception," Morty,

so if it's confusing and stupid,

then so is everyone's

favorite movie.

Aw, man.

I really liked this life.

Well, at least I didn't really

crap my pants.

No, no, that happened

before you went to sleep, Morty.

You're sleeping in your crap

right now.

Out of all the things that

happened to you, that was the

only real thing that, you know,

is that you crapped your pants.

I mean, it's a mess out there.

I got some on my hands, Morty,

and then I got it on the dream

inceptor, and a piece fell in my

mouth.

Aw, man, geez!

Seriously?

Look, d-d-d-don't worry

about it, Morty.

Here, here take these, Morty.

Take these.

Are these pills supposed to wake

me up, or something?

Close.

It's gonna make your kidneys

shut down.

What?!

It's necessary for the

plan, Morty.

Don't even trip, dawg.

It's pretty bad,

emperor snowball.

We're gonna need to

do another operation.

Anything.

Anything for my precious Morty.

Sir, as your accountant,

I must advise you that these

medical expenses are putting you

in serious financial jeopardy.

You could lose your kingdom.

To hell with my kingdom,

bean counter.

I would trade it all for my

human's health and happiness.

Do you think they would have

done this for us?

We are not them!

We are not... them.

Assemble the troops.

I've made a decision.

Taking over the human's world

will lead to nothing but more

heartbreak, more cruelty.

Instead, we will go to a new

world and colonize it with

a society of intelligent dogs,

one that will not make the same

mistakes as humanity and one where

pet insurance will be mandatory.

I'm gonna miss you, snowball.

You can call me snuffles,

Morty, and I'm going to miss

you, too, very much.

Jerry?

I'm sorry.

It's just like the end of

"Old Yeller."

Oh, Jerry.

You mean because

it had dogs in it.

Wow!

A whole world populated

by intelligent dogs.

I wonder what it'll

be like, Rick.

I think it will be great, Morty.

You know...

it could be developed in-into

a very satisfying project for

people of all ages.

I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for

at least 11 minutes a pop.

You know, may-maybe they'll do

it board-driven.

You know, that's a

real comforting idea, Rick.

What do you know, Morty?

What do you know?

Hi, guys. I'm your new

teacher for scary class.

My name is

scary Mr. Johnson.

Uh, actually, you know what?

That's my dad's name, so

why don't you just call me

scary Glenn, yeah?

So, anyway, I understand

your previous teacher

was having you work on

fundamentals of fear.

Which is what is that?

You know?

So, uh, here here's what I say...

you can't learn anything

until you learn... how to chill.

Oooh!

This is how you dream, bitch.

W-what are you talking about?

Rick: it's all fake [burps]

Morty all of it.

Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of

Crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

I couldn't say so until we got

In the shower.

They won't monitor us in here.

Morty: monitor us?! W-who?!

Rick: zigerion scammers,

Morty the galaxy's most

Ambitious, least successful con

Artists.

You know, it's lucky for us

They're also really

Uncomfortable with nudity.

Morty: aw, come on, Rick.

If everyone's just gonna be

Insane today, at least let me be

Insane with jessica.

Rick: i can't [burps] let you

Do that, Morty.

Morty: give it to me!

Rick: no! [ burps ]

You give it to me!

Morty: g-g-give it! No, Rick!

And tell me when they're not.

I think we should make kevin

Look, sir.

What?! No!

W-w-why would you even say that?

Uh, sir, we have a situation

Over here.

If there's a wiener on that

Monitor, i swear to god, stu...

Something is drawing a lot of

Processing power.

Oh, wait. No wonder.

There's another real human in

The simulator.

Jerry: okay, Jerry big

Pitch meeting.

Make-or-break time.

[ whirrin]

You can do this.

How did this happen?!

Where's the abductions

Department?

Hey, man, abductions just

Follows the acquisition order.

Don't put this on

Acquisitions!

We only acquire humans that

Haven'tbeen simulated!

Well, simulations doesn't

Simulate anybody that's been

Abducted, so [chuckles]

Oh, i see! Oh, oh!

It was no one's fault.

Oh, okay. [ chuckles ]

I'm sorry.

Well, then, problem solved.

Oh, wait no.

There's still another human in

Here!

Who is he?

Rick's son-in-law,

Jerry smith.

So far, he hasn't noticed he's

In a simulation.

[ sighs ]

Well, cap his sector at 5%

Processing, keep his settings on

Auto, and we'll deal with him

Later.

Rick sanchez is the target.

Jerry: [ inhales deeply ]

Got to relax.

It's just a pitch.

Got to relax.

[ click ]

[ static ]

This is earth radio.

And now, here's...human music.

[ repetitive rhythmic beepin]

Jerry: hmm. Human music.

I like it.

[ beeping continue]

[ Rick and Morty panting ]

Morty: Rick!

Rick: uhp, uhp, uhp!

Morty, keep your hands off your

Ding-dong!

It's the only way we can speak

Freely.

Look around you, Morty.

Do you really think this [burps]

World is real?

You'd have to be an idiot not to

Notice all the sloppy details.

Look that guy's putting a bun

Between two hot dogs.

Morty: i don't know, Rick.

I mean, i've seen people do that

Before.

Rick: well, look at that old

Lady.

She's she's walking a cat on

A leash.

Morty: uh, mrs. Spencer does

That all the time, Rick.

Rick: look, i-i-i don't want

To hear about mrs. Spencer,

Morty!

She's an idiot!

All right, all right, there.

W-what about that, Morty?

Morty: okay, okay, you got me

On that one.

Rick: oh, really,Morty?

Are you sure you haven't seen

That somewhere in real life

Before?

Morty: no, no.

I haven't seen that.

I mean, why would a pop tart

Want to live inside a toaster,

Rick?

I mean, that would be, like, the

Scariest place for them to live.

You know what i mean?

Rick: you're missing the

Point, Morty.

Why would he drive a smaller

Toaster with wheels?

I mean, does your car look like

A smaller version of your house?

No.

Morty: so, why are they doing

This?

W-what do they want?

Rick: well, that would be

Obvious to you, Morty, if you'd

Been paying attention.

[ siren wails ]

[ tires screech ]

We got the president of the

United states in here!

We need 10cc of concentrated

Dark matter, stat, or he'll die!

Morty: concentrated dark

Matter?

They were asking about that in

Class.

Rick: yeah, it's a special

Fuel i invented to travel

Through space faster than

Anybody else.

These zigerions are always

Trying to scam me out of my

Secrets, but they made a big

Mistake this time, Morty.

They dragged youinto this.

Now they're gonna pay!

Morty: what do you

W-w-what are we gonna do?

Rick: we'll scam the

Scammers, Morty.

And we're gonna take them for

Everything they've got.

Jerry: national apple farmers

Of america, welcome to our ad

Agency.

I'm Jerry smith.

All right.

I'll just...get to the pitch.

Um, simple question, gentlemen,

[ hoarsely ] what are apples?

[ clears throat ] excuse me.

Ahh.

[ coughs, clears throat ]

What are apples?

Apples are food.

And...when do we need food?

When we're hungry.

With that, i give you your new

Slogan!

[ sighs ]

Well, say something!

Do you like it?

Yes.

Jerry: you do?

All: yes.

Jerry: so...i sold it?

[ laughs ] i sold the idea?

All: yes.

Jerry: oh, my god! Thank you!

Together: thank you.

You're welcome.

[ "baker street" plays ]

Jerry: hey!

I just sold my first pitch!

[ dialing ]

Slow down!

Lookin' good.

My man!

[ beeping, telephone ringing ]

Robot Beth: hello.

Jerry: guess who just sold

The apples campaign.

Robot Beth: who just sold the

Apples campaign?

Jerry: me!

I guess it wasn't a rip-off of

"got milk?" after all.

Guess someonewas wrong.

Robot Beth: yes.

Jerry: well, all is forgiven,

Because right now, i've got an

Erection the size of an

East coast lighthouse, and i'm

Coming home to share it with my

Beautiful wife.

Robot Beth: okay.

Jerry: wait really?

Robot Beth: yes.

Jerry: yes!

See you in 10 minutes!

[ cellphone beeps ]

Hey!

I'm going to make love to my

Wife!

Lookin' good.

Slow down!

My man!

[ beeping ]

Morty: aw, geez, Rick.

I-i don't know if i like this

Plan, you know?

I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have

A tendency to make me really

Nervous.

Rick: Morty, relax.

It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s

Out there.

You're gonna be fine.

Just follow my lead.

Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

[ hip-hop beat plays ]

[ cheers and applause ]

Uh-oh, Morty.

This crowd looks too small for

One of ourfamous rap concerts.

I don't think we can perform our

New song, "the recipe for

Concentrated dark matter," for a

Crowd this tiny.

Morty: you got that right,

Rick.

[ cheers and applause ]

Rick: now that's [burps]

More like it!

Morty, here we go.

Let me hear everybody say

"hey-oh!" yeah!

[ crowd cheering ]

All the ladies say, "yeah!"

[ ladies cheering ]

Everybody over 30, do this with

Your hands!

Everybody with a red shirt, jump

Up and down!

[ beeping ]

[ tires screech ]

Jerry: mm. Mm. Mm.

Yeah, don't move.

Mm, mm, mm, mm!

Mm!

[ cheers and applause ]

Rick: yo, everyone whose

First name begins with an "l"

Who isn't hispanic, walk in a

Circle the same number of times

As the square root of your age

Times 10!

[ beeping ]

Run, Morty!

Before the system reboots!

[ squeaking ]

Jerry: yeah! You like that?

Now who's unremarkable?

You hungry for apples?

[ squeaking intensifies ]

Are you hungry...for...apples?!

[ squeaking stops ]

[ sighs deeply ]

[ chuckles ]

Oh, my god.

That's the best sex i've ever

Had in my life.

It's...it's...too good.

I don't deserve this, Beth.

I'm a fraud.

Morty: oh, man, Rick!

W-w-w-where we running to?

Rick: out of the simulation,

Morty.

Normally, the chamber operates

Like a treadmill, with the

Virtual world disappearing

Behind us and being rendered in

Front of us as we move through

It, but while it's frozen,

Morty, we can get to...

The edge.

Here we go.

Morty: holy crap!

Rick: come on, Morty.

Morty: [ grunts ]

Sir, they're over the edge.

Yes, they are.

Just...as...planned.

[ evil laughter ]

Oh, this is going to be such a

Mind [bleep]

Rick: keep your eyes peeled

For the central processing room,

Morty.

That's how we're gonna scam

These idiots.

Morty: so, hey, why do these

Aliens keep coming after you,

Rick, if you're so much smarter

Than them?

Rick: it's an obsession for

Them at this point.

The zi[burps]gerions have been

Trying to outsmart me for years,

Morty.

Every time they do, i'm one step

Ahead of them.

Aha!

Here we go.

Grab as many processors as you

Can carry, Morty.

These guys aren't good at much,

But they're reallygood at

Making these chips.

Morty: i've got so many, i

Can barely hold them all.

[ chuckles ]

Look at look at this.

Oops. I dropped one.

Rick: don't worry about it,

Morty.

There's plenty of them, you

Little goofball.

[ both laugh ]

Come here, Morty! Oh, i gotcha!

Morty: come on, quit it,

Rick!

Quit it! [ laughs ]

Rick: nothing wrong with just

A little bit of horseplay every

Now and then, little fella.

[ glass shatters ]

Morty: wow. What do you know?

Huh. That was easy.

Rick: totes malotes, dawg.

Morty: just kind of hard to

Believe, you know?

Rick: believe it, Morty.

And once again, i'm flying away

With everything i can carry, and

The zigerions got nothing of

Mine.

Jerry: [ sighs ]

Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a...

Minute to talk?

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: look, i'm a fraud.

I mean, let's face it

"hungry for apples" is just a

Rip-off of "got milk?"

It's almost identical.

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: [ sighs ] okay.

I deserve that.

Umm...i guess...i'll just pack

Up my desk.

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: [ crying ]

[ sobbing ] oh, my god.

Wait. You know what?! No!

The milk people don't have a

Patent on simple rhetorical

Questions!

There's not even a single word

In "hungry for apples" that's

Shared by "got milk?"

It's a completely different

Slogan.

It's different!

And i shouldn't be fired.

I should be promoted!

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: yeah!

Wait. Really?

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: yes!

I mean, i'm it may be

Derivative, but it's the most

Successful campaign to come out

Of thagency in a long time.

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: i-i'm not saying it

Should win an award for

Commercials, but it could

Certainly be nominatedfor an

Award for commercials

Specifically about apples,

Like...an appley or something.

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: is there really an

Award called the appley for

Apple-related ad campaigns?

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: could we nominate me?

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

Jerry: holy crap!

[ beeping ]

Rick: get in, Morty.

I'm gonna [burps] be able to use

These processors to make some

Real important science stuff.

[ keypad beeping ]

Huh.

I thought i entered the code

Right.

[ keypad beeping ]

Wha well, what's this?

W-what could this possibly be?

Because it looks like you're

Inside a simulation...

Inside a simulation.

You're still on the ship.

Game-day bucket go boom.

Sir, the, uh, doctor's

Appointment to examine the

Discoloration on your butthole

Flaps was

Too loud, cynthia.

Too loud and too specific.

Rick: uhh...

[ chuckles ]

We've known how to make

Concentrated dark matter for a

Long time.

But now we alsoknow the code to

Your fabled safe, Rick sanchez!

All your most valuable secrets

Will now be ours!

Rick: uh, yeah, until i get

Home before you and change the

Combination, you bunch of

Idiots!

That is why you're never

Getting home.

Get them!

Rick: [ grunts ]

[ aliens shouting, groaning ]

Run, Morty!

[ both panting ]

Morty: oh, my god!

[ beep, click ]

[ mechanical breathing ]

Ow!

[ click, whoosh ]

[ aliens screaming ]

[ both panting ]

Jerry: i got to tell you,

This morning, i didn't even know

This award existed.

Now i'm holdingone.

And...um...

Look, i want to say that today

Was the best day of my life...

But...the truth is, it's it's

More meaningful than that.

My man!

Jerry: yes. Thank you, sir.

[ sighs deeply ]

I...am...finally complete!

[ beeping ]

My my my my man!

Jerry: aah!

What the hell?!

[ beeping ]

No.

Rick: Jerry?!

Morty: dad!

Rick: what are you doing

Here?

W-why are you dressed like a

Waiter?

Screw it. We don't have time.

Come on.

Jerry: [ sobbing ] no!

[ alarm blaring ]

Rick: ohhhhh!

[ beeping ]

Jerry: aah!

All: yes! Yes! Yes!

Oof!

Rick: man up, Jerry!

I may need you to work the

Lasers.

[ beeping ]

[ slurps ]

[ gasps ]

[ alarm blaring ]

Morty: oh, man!

They're hot on our tail, Rick!

Rick: i guess they really do

Have concentrated dark matter.

Morty: well, you know how to

Make it, too, right, Rick?

Rick: yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Uh, check the engine room.

We just need cesium, plutonic

Quarks, and bottled water.

Morty: it's all here, Rick!

Rick: wow, Morty.

Lucky break.

Grab that bucket.

Okay, two parts plutonic quarks,

One part cesium.

Morty: okay. Uh-huh.

[ fizzing ]

All right.

Rick: now empty the water

Bottle into the bucket and pour

It all into the fuel tank so we

Can get the hell out of here!

What are you doing, Morty?!

There's no time!

[ beeping ]

Morty: [ stammering ]

Rick: oh, no.

Jerry: what the

Rick: no!

[ laughter ]

Oh, my god, Rick.

How dumb are you?

You're inside a simulation...

Of a simulation...

Inside another giant simulation!

[ laughs ]

W-we never had the recipe for

Concentrated dark matter.

But we do now!

We do now, sucka!

Rick: you simulated my

Grandson's genitalia?!

Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons

Of bitches!

Kevin fought real hard to

Supervise that project.

You said you weren't gonna

Tell anyone!

I'm never gonna live this down,

Am i?

Rick: all right. Okay.

All right, great. Wonderful.

You win. Can we go home now?

I don't know. Canyou?

Ha! Nice.

Okay, okay.

Show this gullible turd to his

Shuttle.

I'm done with him.

Oh, wait. Let me get a picture.

[ shutter clicks ]

Aww. Look at his face.

He's trying to figure out if

He's in a simulation still.

Are you, Rick?

Are you?

[ laughs ]

You're not.

Or ayou?

Oh, a-and, by the way, i don't

Have discolored butthole flaps.

That was part of the simulation.

Oh.

Uh, sir, should i cancel that

Appointment, then?

Yeah! Of course you should!

[ chuckles ]

No, keep it.

Move it up, actually, if you

Can.

Rick: hey, Jerry, don't worry

About it.

So what if the most meaningful

Day of your life was a

Simulation operating at minimum

Cap[burps]acity?

Jerry: you know what, Rick?

Those guys took youfor a ride,

Too.

You should try having a little

Respect for the dummies of the

Universe, now that you're one of

Us.

Rick: maybe you're right,

Jerry.

Maybe you're right.

[ aliens cheering ]

[ dance music plays ]

All right, everybody.

Two parts plutonic quarks...

One part cesium...

[ fizzing ]

A-and listen, i'm sorry for

Éling earlier.

I-i couldn't ask for a better

Staff.

I love you guys, and i love all

Your families.

And the final ingredient...

Jerry: whoa!

What the hell?!

W-what happened back there?

Rick: why don't you ask the

Smartest people in the universe,

Jerry?

Oh, yeah. [ burps ] you can't.

They blew up.

[ sighs ]

[ beep ]

[ "baker street" play]

[ vocalizing ]

[ vocalizing out of sync ]

[ "baker street" continues ]

Jerry: so...

What do you think?

You're fired.

Jerry: wha

But t-this idea was tested in a

State-of-the-art simulation.

Well, then, it was a terrible

Simulation.

Get out.

[ door opens, closes ]

Man, how does a guy like that go

Home and have sex with his wife?

Rick: hey, Morty.

Morty: what?

Rick: hey, little buddy.

H-h-how you doing in here right

Now?

Morty: aw, geez, Rick.

What are you doing, man?

Rick: y-y-you're a good kid,

Morty.

Y-you're a real l-little

C-character, Morty.

Morty: oh, boy.

Rick: you know, i had a

Really rocky road today,

M-Morty.

You're my little friend, aren't

You?

[ sighs ]

We had some good times together,

Huh, m-Morty?

We

You're a real true hero out in

The fld.

You're a li

You're a real trouper, huh,

M-m-Morty?

Morty: have you been

Drinking, Rick?

Rick: i really appreciate

You, Morty.

Morty: o-okay, cool.

A-all right, Rick

Rick: you little son of a

Bitch!

Y-y are you a simulation?!

Huh?! Are you a simulation?!

Morty: no! No! No!

Rick: you little son of a

Bitch!

Morty: [ gasping ]

Rick: i-i-i'm sorry, Morty.

Y-you're a good

You're a good kid, Morty.

Morty: geez!

Rick: y-you're a good

You're a good kid.

Morty: oh, my god!

Rick: [ snoring ]

Morty: w-w-what the hell?

What a life.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

 Rick: [ PANTING ]

 RUN!

 [ GASPS ]

 MORTY, DO IT!

 HIT THE BUTTON NOW!

 Morty: I CAN'T DO IT, RICK!

 THEY'RE MY PARENTS AND SISTER!

 Rick: MORTY, I ALREADY TOLD

 YOU  IT'S NOT YOUR FAMILY!

 THEY'RE CLONES FROM AN ALTERNATE

 REALITY, POSSESSED BY DEMONIC

 ALIEN SPIRITS FROM ANOTHER

 DIMENSION'S FUTURE!

 DO YOU NEED A MNEMONIC DEVICE

 OR SOMETHING?

 JUST HIT THE BUTTON, ALREADY!

 Beth: [ GROWLING ]

 MORTY, PLEASE, I LOVE

 YOU, SWEETHEART.

 Morty: OH!

 [ GRUNTS ]

 [ CLONES SCREAM ]

 [ MOANS ]

 Rick: GOOD WORK, MORTY.

 YOU KNOW, TH-TH-THESE DEMONIC

 ALIEN SPIRITS ARE REALLY

 VALUABLE.

 YOU OKAY, MORTY?

 I TOLD YOU NOT TO TRUST THAT

 TUNA.

 Morty: I JUST KILLED MY

 FAMILY!

 I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY WERE.

 Rick: I DON'T KNOW, MORTY.

 SOME PEOPLE'D PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR

 THAT KIND OF BREAKTHROUGH.

 Morty: YOU KNOW WHAT, RICK?

 THAT'S IT!

 I'M DONE WITH THESE INSANE

 ADVENTURES!

 THAT WAS REALLY TRAUMATIZING!

 I QUIT! I'M OUT!

 Rick: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

 COME ON, MORTY, DON'T 

 DON'T  DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

 THE UNIVERSE IS A CRAZY,

 CHAOTIC PLACE.

 Morty: YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S

 CRAZY AND CHAOTIC!

 ADVENTURES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

 SIMPLE AND FUN.

 Rick: OH, YEAH, MORTY, YEAH.

 YEAH, THAT  THAT  THAT'S

 REAL EASY TO SAY FROM THE

 SIDEKICK POSITION.

 BUT  BUT, UH, HOW ABOUT NEXT

 TIME YOU BE IN CHARGE, AND THEN

 WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW SIMPLE AND

 FUN IT IS?

 Morty: SERIOUSLY, RICK?

 Y-Y-YOU'LL  YOU'LL LET ME CALL

 THE SHOTS?

 Rick: OKAY, YEAH, FINE.

 BUT LET'S MAKE IT INTERESTING,

 MORTY.

 I-I-I-IF YOUR ADVENTURE SUCKS

 AND WE BAIL HALFWAY THROUGH IT,

 YOU LOSE THE RIGHT TO BITCH

 ABOUT ALL FUTURE ADVENTURES.

 PLUS, YOU HAVE TO DO MY LAUNDRY

 FOR A MONTH.

 Morty: OKAY, ALL RIGHT, TOUGH

 GUY!

 BUT IF MY ADVENTURE'S GOOD, I

 GET TO BE IN CHARGE OF EVERY

 THIRD ADVENTURE!

 Rick: EVERY 10th.

 Morty: DEAL. ALL RIGHT.

 W-WELL, COME ON, LET'S GET

 GOING.

 Beth: DAD, THE DISHWASHER'S

 DOING THAT THING AGAIN.

 Rick: WASHING DISHES?

 Beth: NO. THE OPPOSITE.

 CAN YOU FIX IT?

 Summer: GRANDPA RICK, CAN YOU

 HELP ME WITH MY SCIENCE

 HOMEWORK?

 Rick: YEAH  J-JUST DON'T

 DO IT.

 Summer: GRANDPA!

 Jerry: HEY, RICK, YOU GOT

 SOME KIND OF HAND-SHAPED DEVICE

 THAT CAN OPEN THIS MAYONNAISE

 JAR?

 Rick: WOW. HAT TRICK.

 ALL RIGHT, MORTY, LET'S PUT A

 PIN IN THIS.

 I GOT TO HELP YOUR

 PATHETIC FAMILY.

 Morty: OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE

 SOMETHING A CHICKEN WOULD SAY.

 BAWK, BAWK, BAWK, BAWK, BAWK,

 BAWK.

 Rick: OH, MORTY, YOU DONE DID

 IT THIS TIME.

 IT'S ON.

 I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH YOUR

 ADVENTURE LAY A HUGE FART.

 AS FOR YOU DINGDONGS...

 THIS IS A MEESEEKS BOX.

 LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.

 YOU PRESS THIS.

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

 LOOK AT ME!

 Rick: YOU MAKE A REQUEST.

 MR. MEESEEKS, OPEN JERRY'S

 STUPID MAYONNAISE JAR.

 YES, SIREE!

 Rick: THE MEESEEKS FULFILLS

 THE REQUEST.

 ALL DONE!

 Jerry: WOW!

 Rick: AND THEN IT STOPS

 EXISTING.

 Summer: OH, MY GOD, HE

 EXPLODED!

 Rick: TRUST ME, THEY'RE

 FINE WITH IT.

 KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT  JUST

 [BURPS] KEEP YOUR REQUESTS

 SIMPLE.

 THEY'RE NOT G[BURPS]ODS.

 Morty: ALL RIGHT!

 G-GET OUT OF HERE NOW!

 EVERYBODY OUT OF HERE!

 I GOT A BET TO WIN!

 Beth: SO MANY POSSIBILITIES.

 Summer: MY MIND IS RACING.

 Jerry: IF WE'RE GONNA USE

 THIS THING, WHICH I'M NOT EVEN

 SURE WE SHOULD, WE NEED TO KEEP

 IT SIMP

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

 Summer: I WANT TO BE POPULAR

 AT SCHOOL!

 OOH, OKAY!

 Jerry: SUMMER, WHAT DID I

 JUST 

 OOH, I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

 LOOK AT ME!

 Beth: I-I-I WANT  I WANT TO

 BE A MORE COMPLETE WOMAN!

 Jerry: BETH!

 OH, YEAH! YES, MA'AM!

 Jerry: YOU GUYS ARE DOING IT

 WRONG.

 HE SAID "SIMPLE."

 HEY, THERE. I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

 Jerry: [ CLEARS THROAT ]

 MR. MEESEEKS, I WOULD LIKE TO

 TAKE TWO STROKES OFF MY GOLF

 GAME.

 OOH, YEAH! CAN DO!

 Jerry: NAILED IT.

 Rick: GOD, MORTY, WHAT A

 BORING START TO AN ADVENTURE.

 I DON'T  W-W-W-WHY DIDN'T WE

 JUST GO TO KENTUCKY?

 Morty: RICK, THIS IS A

 FANTASY-TYPE WORLD WITH

 CREATURES AND ALL SORTS OF

 FANTASY THINGS.

 W-WE'RE GOING ON A QUEST, OKAY?

 Rick: CAN'T WAIT.

 Morty: AHEM. EXCUSE ME!

 WE ARE TWO HUMBLE HEROES IN

 SEARCH OF ADVENTURE!

 Rick: OH, MY GOD, SO

 EMBARRASSING.

 AT LAST! TWO HEROES!

 YOU MUST HELP US!

 THIS VILLAGE IS TERRIBLY POOR,

 YET THE GIANT THAT LIVES IN THE

 CLOUDS ABOVE HAS UNTOLD

 TREASURES!

 Morty: YOU KNOW WHAT?

 I-I-I ACCEPT YOUR CALL TO

 ADVENTURE, GOOD SIR, KIND SIR.

 COME ON, RICK.

 THERE'S A GIANT IN THE CLOUDS!

 Rick: YEAH.

 [ BURPS ] BEGINNER'S LUCK.

 IN CONCLUSION, A FRIENDSHIP

 WITH SUMMER SMITH IS THE MOST

 VALUABLE AND ENRICHING

 EXPERIENCE OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES.

 [ APPLAUSE ]

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

 LOOK AT ME!

 THANK YOU!

 UH, MR. MEESEEKS, WAS IT?

 YEAH. GENE VAGINA.

 LISTEN, I'M IN A BIT OF CUSTODY

 THING WITH MY EX AND WAS

 WONDERING 

 NO, I'LL G I'LL GET YOUR INFO

 FROM SUMMER.

 Beth: I GOT PREGNANT AT 17.

 I MEAN, I STILL PUT MYSELF

 THROUGH VETERINARY SCHOOL.

 YES, I'M SUCCESSFUL, BUT WHAT IF

 I HADN'T...

 I'M JUST SAYING, SOMEWHERE ALONG

 THE WAY, I LOST THAT WIDE-EYED

 GIRL FROM MUSKEGON.

 SHE'S STILL THERE, BETH.

 Beth: WELL, HER WAISTLINE

 ISN'T.

 [ LAUGHS ]

 BETH, HAVING A FAMILY DOESN'T

 MEAN THAT YOU STOP BEING AN

 INDIVIDUAL.

 YOU KNOW THE BEST THING YOU CAN

 DO FOR PEOPLE THAT DEPEND ON

 YOU?

 BE HONEST WITH THEM, EVEN IF IT

 MEANS SETTING THEM FREE.

 Beth: YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD

 LEAVE JERRY.

 I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M FINALLY

 HAVING  THIS CONVERSATION.

 [ ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS ]

 MORE WINE?

 Beth: [ CLEARS THROAT ]

 I THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

 Jerry: [ GRUNTS ]

 REMEMBER TO SQUARE YOUR

 SHOULDERS, JERRY.

 Jerry: YEAH, YEAH. I GOT IT.

 [ GRUNTS ]

 THAT'S OKAY.

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME!

 TRY AGAIN AND KEEP YOUR HEAD

 DOWN.

 Jerry: OKAY, WELL, WHICH

 IS IT?

 SQUARE MY SHOULDERS OR KEEP MY

 HEAD DOWN?

 WELL, IT'S BOTH.

 BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU GOT TO

 RELAX.

 Jerry: YOU KNOW WHAT,

 MR. MEESEEKS?

 I DON'T THINK THIS IS WORKING.

 I GIVE UP.

 I'M SORRY, JERRY, BUT IT

 DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS.

 I HAVE TO FULFILL MY PURPOSE SO

 I CAN GO AWAY.

 LOOK AT ME.

 Jerry: WELL, MAKE YOURSELF

 COMFORTABLE, BECAUSE I SUCK.

 NO, JERRY, I'M THE ONE WHO

 SUCKS!

 LET ME TRY SOMETHING.

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

 LOOK AT ME!

 HI, MR. MEESEEKS!

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME.

 HI!

 CAN YOU HELP ME GET TWO

 STROKES OFF OF JERRY'S GOLF

 SWING?

 CAN DO!

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

 IS HE KEEPING HIS SHOULDERS

 SQUARED?

 OOH, HE'S TRYING!

 [ MEDIEVAL MUSIC PLAYING ]

 [ BOTH GRUNT ]

 Rick: ALL RIGHT, MORTY.

 W-W-WE'RE IN YOUR STUPID GIANT'S

 CASTLE.

 W-WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

 Morty: WOULD YOU JUST RELAX,

 RICK?

 ALL WE GOT TO DO IS FIND THE

 TREASURE ROOM, OKAY?

 IT'S NICE AND SIMPLE.

 YOU KNOW, I-I-I'M SORRY

 EVERYTHING'S GOING SO SMOOTHLY

 AND ADVENTUROUSLY.

 [ FOOTSTEPS BOOMING ]

 Rick: UH-OH, MORTY.

 STARTIN' TO GET A LITTLE HAIRY.

 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, BOSS?

 Morty: COME ON, HURRY.

 BEHIND THIS COOKIE JAR.

 FEE! FI! FO! FUM!

 Rick: JUST GIVE UP, MORTY.

 J-J-J THIS IS GAME OVER.

 I'LL TAKE US HOME RIGHT NOW.

 YOU JUST SAY THE WORD.

 Morty: NO WAY, RICK.

 THIS IS ALL PART OF IT.

 ADVENTURES HAVE CONFLICT.

 DEAL WITH IT.

 I SMELL THE BLOOD OF 

 WHOOP!

 [ CRUNCH ]

 [ GROANING ]

 Morty: HOLY CRAP.

 Rick: OH, BOY.

 HE LOOKS PRETTY BAD DOWN THERE,

 MORTY.

 LOOKS LIKE HE'S BLEEDING OUT.

 OH, JESUS! DALE!

 YOU SONS OF BITCHES!

 Morty: OH, MAN.

 Rick: UH-OH.

 [ Speed-dialing ]

 HELLO, 911?

 MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY

 TINY PEOPLE!

 HE'S DYING!

 [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ]

 HEY, LOOK, WE GET IT.

 YOU'RE LITTLE, YOU'RE DOWN ON

 YOUR LUCK, YOU THINK, "HEY, HE'S

 A GIANT.

 WHY DON'T WE BREAK INTO HIS

 HOME, ROB HIM, AND MURDER HIM?"

 Morty: TH-TH BUT THAT'S NOT

 HOW IT WENT DOWN!

 OH, WELL, IT'S GOING DOWN

 LIKE THAT.

 YOU'RE  BOTH GOING DOWN LIKE

 THAT.

 Rick: OOH, BOY, MORTY, YOU'RE

 REALLY SHOWING ME HOW IT'S DONE.

 RE[BURPS]AL STRAIGHTFORWARD AND

 FUN.

 Summer: LIKE, LETTING GO OF

 THE NEED TO BE POPULAR IS WHAT

 MAKES PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

 Beth: THE MOST IMPORTANT LOVE

 YOU CAN RECEIVE IS FROM

 YOURSELF.

 OKAY, JERRY, YOU GOT TO JUST

 CHOKE UP ON THE CLUB!

 Jerry: WELL, WHICH IS IT,

 CHOKE UP OR FOLLOW-THROUGH?!

 AWW, COME ON, JERRY, WE'VE

 BEEN OVER THIS.

 YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO DO BOTH!

 THIS IS AS FRUSTRATING FOR US

 AS IT IS FOR YOU.

 Jerry: DON'T TELL ME THAT!

 THAT JUST PUTS PRESSURE ON ME!

 JUST TRY TO RELAX.

 Jerry:  YOU TRY TO RELAX!

 HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO RELAX?!

 IT IS A PARADOX!

 UGH, THESE MEESEEKS, HUH?

 KIND OF A HANDFUL.

 I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU TWO

 MUST BE GOING THROUGH.

 Beth: OUR MEESEEKS HAVE BEEN

 GONE FOR HOURS, JERRY.

 Jerry: YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

 Beth: NOTICE ANYTHING

 DIFFERENT?

 Jerry: I-I-I'M SORRY. HOURS?

 Summer: DAD, MOM IS A

 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN!

 LOOK AT HER!

 YOU  WILL LOSE HER!

 Jerry: UHH...

 HEY, JERRY, YOU MIND IF WE

 GET BACK TO THE TASK AT HAND?

 MEESEEKS DON'T USUALLY HAVE TO

 EXIST THIS LONG.

 IT'S GETTING WEIRD.

 ORDER IN THE COURT!

 BEFORE THE JURY REACHES ITS

 VERDICT, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT

 I CONSIDER YOU BOTH  VERY GUILTY.

 Rick: OH, GREAT ADVENTURE,

 BUDDY.

 RICK AND MORTY GO TO GIANT

 PRISON.

 YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY DROPS THE

 SOAP, IT'S GONNA LAND ON OUR

 HEADS AND CRUSH OUR SPINES,

 MORTY.

 YOU KNOW, I-I-I-IT'LL BE REALLY

 EASY TO RAPE US AFTER THAT.

 Morty: WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY,

 RICK.

 Rick: HOW?

 THEY TOOK MY PORTAL GUN.

 THIS IS AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE,

 MORTY.

 YOU KNOW, W-W-W-WHAT DO YOU

 THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN, SOME

 MAGICAL ANGEL'S GONNA SHOW UP

 AND THEN 

 FEE! FI! FO! FUM!

 I SMELL THE VIOLATION OF CIVIL

 LIBERTIES!

 YOUR HONOR, I'M FROM A

 TINY-PERSONS ADVOCACY GROUP AND

 I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND A MOTION

 TO DISMISS.

 THESE LITTLE MEN WERE NEVER READ

 THEIR GIANT RIGHTS AND ARE

 THEREFORE FREE-FI TO FO-HOME.

 Rick: W-WHAT THE HELL IS HE

 TALKING ABOUT?

 THEY'RE FREE TO GO, IS WHAT I

 MEANT.

 I-I-I'M DECONSTRUCTING OUR 

 OUR  OUR THING WE SAY.

 WE'RE GIANTS. NOBODY GOT THAT?

 WHATEVER.

 Morty: OH, MAN, WHAT DID I

 TELL YOU, RICK?

 WE DID IT!

 Rick: ALL RIGHT, MORTY, LOOKS

 LIKE THE PORTAL GUN'S STILL

 WORKING.

 YOU READY TO HEAD HOME?

 Morty: OH, YEAH, YOU'D LIKE

 THAT, WOULDN'T YOU, RICK?

 WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

 WE'RE NOT BAILING OUT JUST YET.

 YOU KNOW, W-WE'RE GONNA GO FIND

 SOME TREASURE OR  OR SOMETHING

 AND  AND WE'RE GONNA BRING IT

 TO THOSE VILLAGERS.

 Rick: MORTY, CUT YOUR LOSSES.

 THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A WASH.

 Morty: YEAH, YOU WERE SAYING

 THAT BACK  BACK W-W-W-WHEN WE

 FIRST GOT ARRESTED, BUT HERE WE

 ARE, YOU KNOW, WALKING DOWN THE

 [ EAGLE SCREECHES ]

 Rick: OH, BOY, MORTY.

 Morty: USUALLY, WALKING DOWN

 THE COURTHOUSE STEPS IS THE EASY

 PART OF THE ADVENTURE.

 Morty: I SAY GIVE ME A HAND,

 SIDEKICK.

 Rick: [ SIGHS ]

 [ MEESEEKS éLING ]

 Jerry: EVERYBODY SHUT UP!

 LET ME TRY!

 [ GRUNTS ]

 DAMN IT! DAMN IT! DAMN IT!

 Beth: I'M GOING OUT.

 Jerry: WAIT. WHAT?

 Beth: WELL, YOU'RE BUSY.

 I'M HUNGRY.

 I THOUGHT I'D GO OUT.

 DO YOU WANT ME TO BE HAPPY OR DO

 YOU WANT ME TO BE IN PRISON?

 Jerry: WHOA, WHOA, WHERE IN

 THE HELL IS 

 I'LL TAKE YOU TO DINNER.

 [ MEESEEKS éL ]

 HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

 IT'S HARD BEING ME, TOO.

 I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

 Beth: [ SIGHS ]

 [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

 Jerry: LOOK, I'VE GOT A

 MARRIAGE TO KEEP TOGETHER.

 AT THIS POINT, MY GOLF SWING IS

 MORE YOUR PROBLEM THAN MINE.

 [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

 I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

 I JUST WANT TO DIE!

 WE ALL WANT TO DIE!

 WE'RE MEESEEKS!

 WHY DID YOU EVEN ROPE ME INTO

 THIS?

 'CAUSE HE ROPED  ME INTO THIS!

 WELL, HIM OVER THERE, HE

 ROPED  ME INTO THIS!

 WELL, HE ROPED  ME INTO THIS!

 WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

 HE  HE ROPED  ME INTO THIS.

 WELL, THAT ONE OVER THERE

 ROPED  ME INTO THIS.

 WELL, HE ROPED  ME INTO THIS.

 [ BOTH GRUNTING ]

 Rick: YEAH, MORTY, THIS IS

 THE PART OF THE STORY EVERYBODY

 LOVES  SCALING DOWN

 650,000 OVERSIZED STEPS.

 Morty: ALL RIGHT, OKAY,

 Y-YOU KNOW, IF THIS WAS A STORY,

 THIS PART WOULDN'T BE INCLUDED,

 STUPID.

 HEY, RICK, W-W-W-W-W-WHAT DO YOU

 KNOW?

 LOOK DOWN THERE.

 LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF TAVERN

 OR SOMETHING BUILT RIGHT INTO

 THE SIDE OF THE STEP.

 [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

 OH, WOW, RICK.

 NOW,  THIS IS MORE LIKE IT.

 LOOK, THERE'S LITTLE

 STAIRCASE-SHAPED PEOPLE IN HERE.

 A-ALL KINDS OF CRAZY CHARACTERS.

 THIS PLACE IS GREAT, YOU KNOW?

 IT'S WHIMSICAL  AND FUN.

 Rick: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING

 AT, MOTHER[BLEEP]

 Morty: EASY, RICK.

 PAY THEM NO MIND.

 THOSE STAIR GOBLINS CAN BE

 MOODY.

 NOW, WHAT CAN I GETCHA?

 WE'VE GOT SKARLOG POPPIES,

 FLURLOW, HALZINGERS, BLOOGIES,

 JUICY TIME BABIES.

 Rick: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, H-HOW

 ABOUT SOME SCOTCH WHISKEY?

 YOU GOT ANY OF THAT AROUND HERE?

 OR JUST A BUNCH OF NONSENSE

 WORDS?

 Morty: RICK.

 WE'LL HAVE TWO BLOOGIES, PLEASE.

 AND, UH, WE WERE WONDERING, IS

 THERE A FASTER WAY TWO HEROES

 COULD GET DOWN THESE STAIRS?

 Y'ALL NEED TO RIDE DOWN THE

 STAIRS?

 MY NAME IS

 SLIPPELY-SLIPPERY STAIR.

 I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN THERE FOR

 25 SHMECKELS.

 Rick: 25 SHMECKELS?

 I-I-I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH  I

 DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

 IS THAT A LOT? IS IT A LITTLE?

 THAT'S EXACTLY HOW MUCH I

 SPENT ON MY BIG FAKE BOOBIES.

 HI, I'M MR. BOOBY BUYER.

 I'LL BUY THOSE BOOBIES FOR

 25 SHMECKELS.

 IT'S A TEMPTING OFFER, BUT

 I'M GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE.

 RATS! WHAT A SHAME.

 Rick: MORTY, YOUR ADVENTURE'S

 IN A SPIRAL.

 FOR REAL, MAN, TIME TO PULL OUT.

 Morty: YOU KEEP HECKLING MY

 ADVENTURE, RICK!

 YOU KNOW WHY?

 Rick: UH, BECAUSE IT'S LAME?

 Morty: IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE

 PETTY!

 YOU KNOW, H-HOW MANY TIMES HAVE

 I HAD TO FOLLOW YOU INTO SOME

 NONSENSICAL BULL CRAP?

 I ALWAYS ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES,

 RICK.

 WHY CAN'T YOU?

 LOOK, I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK, AND

 WHEN I COME BACK, I-IF YOU

 HAVEN'T LEARNED HOW TO LIGHTEN

 UP, DON'T BE HERE!

 Rick: WHATEVER.

 IT'S BECOME CLEAR  LOOK AT

 ME  THAT IF WE CONCENTRATE ALL

 OUR EFFORTS ON JERRY'S

 FOLLOW-THROUGH, WE WILL SOLVE

 THIS PROBLEM.

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS.

 I'M MR. MEESEEKS. LOOK AT ME.

 THE ONLY THING THAT'S CLEAR IS

 THAT CHOKING UP IS THE ONE TRUE

 SOLUTION.

 LOOK AT ME. I'M MR. MEESEEKS.

 I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP JERRY

 FOR TWO DAYS, AN ETERNITY IN

 WORKED.

 Morty: I HOPE SO.

 BUT I'M STARTING TO GET NERVOUS

 TOO FAR OFF THE RAILS.

 [ LAUGHS ] ISN'T THAT WHAT

  I MEAN, THEY  THEY MATE ONCE,

  AND THEN THEY, YOU KNOW,

  DECAPITATE THE PARTNER.

  I MEAN, IT'S A WHOLE RITUAL.

  IT'S REALLY GRUESOME AND TOTALLY

  OPPOSITE.

  THERE'S NO LOVE AT ALL.

  I-I-I BASICALLY MIXED THIS WITH

  A MORE CONTAGIOUS FLU VIRUS.

  IT SHOULD NEUTRALIZE THE WHOLE

  THING, MORTY.

  IT'LL ALL BE OVER VERY SHORTLY.

  [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

  UH, BY THE WAY, MORTY, I KNOW

  YOU DIDN'T ASK OR ANYTHING, BUT

  I'M NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING SEX

  WITH YOU.

  >> Morty: I DON'T  THAT

  DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, RICK.

  HOW DOES THAT ADD UP TO NORMAL

  >> Morty: WHAT, MORTY, YOU WANT

  ME TO SHOW YOU MY MATH?

  I'M SORRY  A-ARE YOU THE

  >> Rick: COME ON, MORTY.

  I'M GREAT.

  THAT'S THE REAL REASON.

  ME!

  IT'S FINE. EVERYTHING IS FINE.

  THERE'S AN INFINITE NUMBER OF

  REALITIES, MORTY, AND IN A FEW

  DOZEN OF THOSE, I GOT LUCKY AND

  TURNED EVERYTHING BACK TO

  NORMAL.

  I JUST HAD TO FIND ONE OF THOSE

  REALITIES IN WHICH WE ALSO

  HAPPEN TO BOTH DIE AROUND THIS

  TIME.

  NOW WE CAN JUST SLIP INTO THE

  PLACE OF OUR DEAD SELVES IN THIS

  REALITY AND EVERYTHING WILL BE

  FINE.

  WE'RE NOT SKIPPING A BEAT,

  MORTY.

  NOW, HELP ME WITH THESE BODIES.

  >> Morty: THIS IS INSANE.

  >> Rick: LOOK, MORTY, I'LL GRAB

  MYSELF, YOU GRAB YOURSELF, OKAY?

  I MEAN, T-T-T-THAT SEEMS FAIR TO

  ME  I MEAN, THAT SEEMS LIKE A

  FAIR WAY TO DIVVY IT UP.

  >> Morty: RICK, WHAT ABOUT THE

  REALITY WE LEFT BEHIND?

  >> Rick: WHAT ABOUT THE REALITY

  WHERE HITLER CURED CANCER,

  MORTY?

  THE ANSWER IS DON'T THINK ABOUT

  IT.

  IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN DO THIS

  EVERY WEEK, ANYWAYS.

  WE GET THREE OR FOUR MORE OF

  THESE, TOPS.

  NOW, PICK UP YOUR DEAD SELF AND

  COME ON.

Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens

for a broken defraculator.

That is multiphase

quantum resonator.

- Well, does it defraculate?

- No.

Then it's a broken defraculator.

Like you would even know

dick about fraculation.

Your planet just got cellphones

and the coverage still sucks!

Yeah, yeah, and your

species eat sulfur.

So lets say 60 smidgens.

I tell you what...

I'll do you a favor.

I throw in a fart.

Hey, Rick...

You think maybe I could get

something from this place?

Like a souvenir?

Like just to have, like

something cool, you know?

Not here Morty.

We'll stop somewhere else,

because you know,

there is always another pawn shop.

OK, I just...

You know, I thought that robot over

there, looked pretty cool, you know?

Oh, it looks cool, huh?

- That's why you want it?

- Yeah, you know?

I mean... it's different

from the stuff on earth.

And you know, you take me to all these

crazy places across the galaxy

and you know, I don't

really have anything to...

to remember all those trips by.

It'd be kind of cool like

a souvenir, you know?

Like what if you passed away

or died or something?

I wouldn't even have

anything to remember

all the cool stuff

we did, you know.

Okay, 60 for the resonator

and my grandson wants the sex robot.

So we're just going to pretend

this isn't happening?

I'm not saying that's a bad idea.

Just asking.

Rick, why did you let Morty

bring that thing into our house?

What do you want from me?

He thought it looked cool,

you know what I mean?

Alright, back to...

back to...

back upstairs.

Well, I'm intervening.

Intervening with puberty?

You'll turn him into Ralph Finnes

in Red Dragon.

He is at that age,

let's just be proud of him.

Jesus, did I really set

the bar that low?

Rick, could you come

with me please?

Quickly!

OK, now if we here squeaking

we intervene.

Where is the sex robot Morty?

That is Gwendoline.

I mean the robot.

She started beeping, and then

transformed and tried to fly away.

Strange.

That's usually the man's job.

You know what I'm

talking about, Morty?

Morty.

That's my catchphrase,

remember?

Remember how I cemented

that catchphrase?

Alright, alright

seriously though.

Let me grab this thing.

Come on.

- Rascal.

- Okay... unacceptable

What is going on?

Alright...

What is that?

I think Morty's robot was designed

for more than long weekends.

Genetic compiler,

incubation chamber.

Yeah, this here is some

kind of baby maker.

And that there is half Morty

and half... who knows... what.

It's my bad guys

I'll take care of it.

Hey listen,

you guys quarantine

the house when Summer

brought olives from Mexico.

This thing could grow

to the size of Delaware.

It might eat brains

and exhale space AIDS.

We gotta be careful.

I lost the chance

to be careful, Rick.

I'm a father now, you know?

It's time for me to be responsible.

Isn't that right...

- Don't name it!

- Morty Jr.?

Oh crap, he named it.

Well Dad, it's a living thing.

And it's half human.

And it was born on America's soil

which entitles it...

Jerry, majoring in civics

was your mistake.

Don't punish us for it.

Fine. I'm gonna take this

thing into my workshop,

and do a little

bit of investigating.

Do not let that thing

out of your sight.

It looks harmless now, but it could

grow into something dangerous.

- Like the Insane Clown Posse.

- Yeah, good one, Jerry.

2003 just called and

wants its easy target back.

He is a like little me.

You don't think he'll turn

into a monster, do you?

They always do.

1995 called, they want...

their "certain year called wanting

its blank back" formula back.

Why, Jerry?

Why expend the effort?

Life is effort,

and I'll stop when I die.

Out.

- What you doing?

- Well, I can't solve...

the problem my way thanks to...

your family's primitive

biological hang ups.

Gross. I might have just touched

one of Morty's loads.

But maybe I can find

suitable parents

for Morty Jr. on this

robot homeworld,

which is...

Gazorpazorp in the

Andromeda system.

- Scoot Summer.

- Don't you need a new companion...

now that Morty is

in the family way?

I don't do adventures

with chicks, Summer.

Oh right, because there is

something about having a wiener...

...that would make me better

walking through a hole?

Oh crap.

Grandpa Rick!

Help!

Help!

Grandpa Rick!

Still think it's a good idea to go

through a hole without a wiener?

- I wanna go home!

- Yeah, no duh.

Great, now I have to

take over a whole planet

because of your stupid boobs.

You're doing great, Morty.

Really you think? I mean

I'm not doing much of anything.

What do I do if it cries?

Then you put it down

and let it cry itself out.

Yeah, right.

We tried that technique on Summer

and she is gonna end up stripping.

Isn't she?

Yes she is.

She is gonna strip her attention

because she was denied it.

Stop filling it with

your own insecurity.

You're gonna turn

it into Mort...

more... more... more of you.

Well, we can't all be raised

like reptiles

by a mentally-ill scientist.

What the...

Listen to me. I am not

rewarding this behavior.

Knock it off both of you!

Give me him!

Give me my baby!

You're both nuts.

I'm gonna raise Morty Jr. myself.

<i>Where is your hands?

There's your hands.</i>

<i>And that's how we

play happy hands.</i>

Oh, you are going to

ruin that kid, Morty.

At least we can agree on that.

Thanks, dumb dumb.

I said "thanks, dumb dumb".

Go get more.

Summer, put your burqa on!

That burqa is a human rights violation,

and I spent a lot on this top.

Look, I'm trying to repair

portal gun with

with bunch of sex doll parts

and I have to do it one-handed

to keep these belushis from

cutting you off.

The least you could do

is be ashamed of your gender.

What's the deal with this place?

Why is it such a sausage planet

and how did such

backwards idiots invent robots?

Obviously at some point

the Gazorpians became so

evolved that they replaced

females with birthing machines.

The resultant lack of

distraction and handpecking

allowed them to focus

entirely on war,

so they bombed themselves

back to the stone age

and now they just fight

with each other over

fake pussy with sticks

and rocks all day long.

You think it's efficient

to get rid of women?

You ever see a line

for the men's room?

Are you hea... Do you lis...

You hear me, summer?

The... plot... thickens.

You might wanna cover

your eyes, Summer.

Yeah, like it was my

dream to watch.

Summer, grab hold.

Grandpa Rick,

where are we going?

Well obviously Summer, it appears

the lower tier of this society

is being manipulated through

sex and advanced technology

by a hidden ruling class.

Sound familiar?

Ticketmaster.

There we go, Summer.

Hey brother.

Hey bro.

Nice racket you got

going on here.

Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez

from earth dimension C-137.

Don't mean any harm.

Coming in peace.

It's all cool in the...

good in the neighborhood.

That was what I was trying...

That's what I meant.

Oh, I get it.

The old "behind every

great man amazon" twist.

Silence!

Your slave is ill-mannered.

- My slave?

- We assume...

you are from a more

primitive world,

where men are still permitted

to be servants.

If he is a rogue male, tell us now,

and we will kill him.

He's my slave.

He's my slave.

He is definitely my slave.

Oh boy, what's the opposite of...

Am I right ladies

and gentlemen?

You guys kidding me.

Morty Jr., you're gonna be a special

little guy, aren't you?

You're my special little guy.

DA

What was that, Morty Jr.?

Were you gonna say Dada?

Say Dada.

Death!

Dada.

Domination!

Dada?

Destruction, domination.

Nice.

<i>The spider in sector C

is still alive.</i>

<i>Plan your route accordingly

and expect delays.</i>

<i>We're not telling you what to do.

We're just sharing how we feel.</i>

<i>And now, weather. Is anyone

else cold or is it just me?</i>

I am Marsha,

ruler of Gazorpazorp.

I am here if you need to talk.

What is this place?

Paradise. We built it during

the great passive aggression,

when females separated

from the males

due to their increasingly

destructive behavior.

- I'm here if you need to talk.

- I'm here if you need to talk.

From here we dispense

mechanical surrogates

to maintain our population.

Fertilized surrogates are

returned here to our nursery.

The females are placed

into educational program

where they can discover a

service to our paradise

that fulfills them most.

The males...

they get to play outside.

That was just a baby.

And within a day he'll be

an adult male Gazorpian,

one of the most aggressively

violent creatures in the universe.

Wait a minute.

We're here because a male Gazorpian

was born on our planet.

You speak when you're

spoken to ding-a-ling.

It's true though. One of your

babies was born on earth.

Are you the ruler of this earth?

How did you know?

- The quality of your top.

- Do you love it?

I love it.

I'm here if you need to talk.

I'm here if you need to talk.

- I'm here if you need to talk.

- I'm here if you need to talk.

If the Gazorpian is male

your earth is in grave danger.

We will give you passage back home,

so it can be terminated.

But first, mojitos!

We don't have time for mojitos!

You are insulting them.

I don't care Summer.

This place is the worst!

I wanna go home!

Well, it really doesn't matter

what you want

because this is a sane place,

where women rule.

You know what I have

to say about that?

<i>I can not believe... my ears.</i>

Boy, who let the

frogs out, huh?

Grandpa!

- Grandpa?

- That sounds patriarchal.

It means father of fathers.

Then this one is

not your slave

and your earth is yet another

planet dominated by men.

It's not dominated

by us, okay?

On earth men and

women are equals.

Equals? We make 70% of your

salary for the same job!

Seize them!

Was this really the time

to make that point, Summer?

This is for you Daddy.

Oh man.

Okay.

Listen to me Morty Jr.

I gotta tell you

something very important, okay?

Killing is bad.

Bad.

You are silly, Daddy.

No, Morty Jr.

I'm being serious, okay?

You need to put your energy

into something else.

I mean what about dancing?

Would you like to learn how to dance?

I like to dance...

on the graves of my enemies.

No, Morty Jr.!

Daddy, can I go outside?

No, absolutely not!

But that's where all the people

and the animals are.

Yeah, but you can't go

out there because...

The air is poisonous, for you!

You will die if...

You'll die instantly

if you ever leave this house.

Do you hear me?

- For real?

- For real times a million, buddy.

So let's just stay inside...

let's try dancing. Right?

Look at me.

We're gonna dance. Come on.

Join, dance with me here.

We love to dance.

Why do we love to dance?

Because I said so!

- Nice.

- Nice.

So, what are you in for?

Because I got a big...

you know...

penis between my legs.

What are you in for?

The worst crime

a female can commit.

Veronica Ann Bennett, I find you

guilty of having bad bangs.

You ever noticed the ones with bad

bangs always have three names?

You are hereby sentenced to...

the silent treatment!

This is gonna be cake.

No!

Jackie!

Rick and Summer of earth.

For the crimes of treason

against woman kind

and for creating the sound

of which we do not speak

because it does not exist,

you are hereby sentenced to...

What? A night on the couch?

Death.

I hate you so much right now.

This will be the first

instance of capital punishment

in our society in 500 years

due to our awesomeness.

So we are forced to improvise.

We placed a large

boulder on that ledge.

Holly shit! You're gonna

crush us with a boulder?!

No! Stop interrupting!

The boulder falls onto a lever

that will launch...

- Knives.

- What?!

Just give me a gun,

I'll kill myself.

Stop interrupting!

The knives will...

Fine!

You were right the

first time, okay?

The boulder crushes you.

I just didn't want to

admit you were right.

- Happy?!

- Just ignore them.

- Ignore them.

- Such an asshole.

Look, I'm sorry, Summer.

I feel bad that I let you

drag us into this.

I wish could have been

a better grandpa to you.

And you know, for

what it's worth,

that is a really nice cute top,

that you're wearing there.

Top?

My top!

My top!

The same top you

complimented earlier.

Look! Look at the tag!

Read it!

It says...

Mark Jacobs.

Mark? Jacob?

These are names of the penis.

Yes.

An earth man made this top.

Maybe on your planet

separation of the genders

is the right thing to do,

but on earth, a certain

percentage of males are born gay,

which is why my clothes

are better than all of yours.

It's true.

And sometimes the truth hurts.

But it must be accepted.

Like if I told you

that you're using

a wrong color foundation

for your skin,

and it ends at your neck

making you look like a party clown.

Okay.

Ouch. Noted.

But the fact remains if you impose

Gazorpazorp's laws on earth

you're no better than the men

whose farts shall remain unspoken

And if you think my top is cute,

you cannot execute.

Very well. Give the earth people

spacecraft

so they may head

back to their weird planet

where women are kind of equal,

but not really.

Good job, Summer,

and thanks girls.

You girls are really...

something, I tell you that.

You know,

when we first got here

- I was like...

- Give them a ship, now.

Morty Jr.! Smoking?!

That is not okay!

What are you gonna

do, ground me?

I can't go outside anyway!

So what? You could

do things inside.

You could play guitar,

you could masturbate...

I don't wanna masturbate,

I wanna conquer the planet!

Oh, here we go again!

Who do you think

is gonna love you

if you conquer the

planet Morty Jr.?

Love.

That's all you care about.

What about weapons? What about

domination of the enemy?

Alright, that's it, no

more History Chanel!

This TV is for cartoons

and video games only!

I hate video games!

You take that back!

Give it to me!

I didn't mean!

I didn't mean that!

I didn't mean to do that!

I'm sorry!

I can't take this anymore!

I'd rather breath poison than

living another minute with you!

No! No, no, no! Stop!

My life has been a lie!

God is dead!

The government's lame!

Thanksgiving is about

killing Indians!

Jesus wasn't born on Christmas,

they moved the date,

it was a pagan holiday!

- Oh, Dad!

- Yes, Morty?

My son is gonna

take over the planet,

and I am too young to drive.

Can you help me get him back?

I suppose, Morty.

I suppose.

But first a deep sip from a very

tall glass of "I told you so".

Oh my god, please Dad,

come on!

Dad, there he is!

Oh God.

Hey stop that!

Oh my god, oh my god, Dad!

Morty Jr., no!

It's me.

It's Dad.

It's okay.

Put the car down Morty Jr.

No!

Where's your hands?

Where's your hands?

My car!

♪ And that's how we play

handy hands. ♪

- Out of the way, Morty!

- No!

Morty, that's one of

the most violently

aggressive creature

in the universe.

He's my son!

And if you hurt him,

you have to kill me, Rick!

Dad, I'm so confused.

I know Morty Jr.

I'm sorry.

I ended up lying to you

and yelling at you

just like my

parents did to me.

You know parents are just

kids having kids.

One minute you like how

a shiny robot looks,

the next minute you're in

a fist fight with your alien son.

I'm an alien?

We all have bad impulses,

bad thoughts.

We just have to learn to channel them

into something constructive.

But I want to murder

everyone I see.

Well you know, maybe there is a job

out there for people that feel that way.

Actually, there is.

Hi, I'm Brad Anderson.

Creator of the nationally syndicated

comic strip "Marmaduke".

You should consider

being a creative.

I'm hunted by

uncontrollable thoughts

of mutilation and sexual assaults

on a nearly daily basis.

But you know? I channeled

it all into my work.

I never got that impression

from reading Marmaduke.

Well, did you get the impression

I was trying to make you laugh?

Tell me that wasn't

Brad Anderson.

See, you hear that, Morty Jr.?

Maybe you could try being

a creative of some kind.

Maybe? I always

have sort of wanted

to see my face on the

back of a novel.

I mean what I really wanna do

is slit people's throat,

but, beyond that.

I know you can do it, son.

I think it's time

I get a place of my own.

I promise I call you every day

I need money

or a place to do laundry.

So, I assume this novel

your son writes

is gonna pay for my rear Axel?

Isn't it interesting Summer,

that after all that stuff we just did

nothing really mattered,

there was no point to it.

Kind of makes you wonder, huh?

- About nothing

- Are you sure it doesn't make

you re-evaluate your policy

about taking girls on adventure?

No I'd say given

what we've been through,

that I was right the whole time,

and any epiphanies

about gender politics were

projection of your feminine insecurity.

But hey, why don't you

have pink spaceship?

Go ride around,

and have a jolly old time.

Maybe that'll shut you up.

Dad? Summer? Where were you

guys this whole time?

On Gazorpazorp.

Where were you?

I was reading a newspaper.

Oh, that's interesting, Beth.

You know it's funny...

I heard about a little bit

of news, myself.

Take a look.

Take a listen.

This world... still got a...

still got a chance!

See you guys next week!

See everybody next week!

Mortimer Smith Jr.

New York Times best selling author.

Your book is about innocence,

the definition of it,

and inevitably

its impossibility.

Is it autobiographical?

Certainly.

I mean,

all writing is, in my opinion.

But, my...

My father...

kept me locked in the house

until I was a teenager.

And there was violence and...

threats of poison gas.

- But also dancing.

- But you persevered

and created this masterpiece

from your suffering.

Smith Jr.'s mind-bending novel,

"My Horrible Father"

in every store

<i>and on everyone's mind pick

it up, we'll be right back.</i>

It's a thankless job, Morty.

You did the best you could.

I hope he's eating enough.

I choose Veronica. </ I>

- What?

- Yes!

- Called it. - Why would he choose Veronica?

- Because he loves her.

Well--if it's any consolation, Summer,

none of it mattered, and

the entire show is stupid.

Okay, I've got

an idea, Rick.

You show us your concept of "good

TV," and we'll crap all over that.

I thought

you'd never ask.

Hey!

Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite?

It conducts electrons across dimensions.

Twenty percent accurate, as usual, Morty.

The important thing being I just upgraded

our cable package with programming

from every conceivable reality.

Wait, does that mean we get

Showtime Extreme?

How about Showtime Extreme in a

world where man evolved from corn.

<i> We're not so different.

We're both corn of action. </ I>

<i> Yeah. But one of

us is...DEAD CORN! </ i>

- Boring.

- Summer,

You just spent three months,

watching a man choose a fake wife.

So what? It'd be better if

the people were corn?

Jerry, you don't get it.

This is infinite TV...

from infinite

universes. Look.

<i> This shit is delicious. </ i>

A movie about a

guy eating shit.

A violent

Antiques Show...

- It's a pleasure to have you.

- The pleasure's all mine.

Letterman from a

time line where Jerry's famous...

- Wait!

- What in the hell?

I agree.

Where is this going?

No, the other thing!

Go back!

Really?

All right, fine.

<i> Glenn, this is a court order.

It says you can't eat shit anymore. </ I>

All right, Jerry, when you're right,

you're right. Now I'm hooked.

Coming up next on "Shmloo's 

the Shmloss," Shmlony has a nightmare.

Amazing. A dimension where all

proper nouns begin with "Schmla."

<i> Schmlove,

All right, that got... th-that actually

got old pretty quick.

Rick, would you please

go back to me on David Letterman?

Infinity's a big number, Jerry.

I don't remember the channel.

- Go back, go back!

- Jeez...

Oh my God!

Dad's in Cloud Atlas!

I'm in Cloud Atlas!

What's Cloud Atlas?

How is this possible?

Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities.

Including a time line where Jerry's a movie star.

Look, you guys are getting excited about

the wrong aspect of this device. Wa--Look at this.

<i> And now, another

Quick Mystery. </ i>

<i> I just want to know who could've done

something like this. It's a travesty! </ I>

<i> I did. See this knife and all the blood

on it? Here's my fingerprints. </ I>

<i> Guilty! I sentence you

to life in prison. </ I>

<i> Guilty!

Sentenced to murder. </ i>

<i> Wow, that one was really

Now who wants to watch random, 

crazy TV shows from different dimensions...

a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically

obsess about their alternate self?

- I want to obsess about myself.

- The narcisstic stuff.

(Sigh) Here. These scan your retinas, and

let you view parallel time lines

through genetically matching

versions of your eyes.

Go fetch!

- Yes! This is so cool!

- Ladies First!

I'm proud of you, Morty.

Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. 

Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!

Only $100! That's fair! </ I>

<i> I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson!

Everything's black, I can't see a thing! </ I>

<i> And also I can't feel anything either,

did I mention that? </ i>

<i> But that's not as catchy

as having ants in your eyes. </ i>

<i> So that always goes, you know,

off by the wayside. </ i>

<i> I can't feel.

It's a very rare disease. </ i>

<i> All my s-- All my nerves,

they don't allow for the sensation of touch. </ i>

<i> So I never know what's going on.

Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know. </ I>

Are we sure we want to do this?

Look at our own alternative lives?

You're right. Maybe we should

just play Yahtzee. Give me those!

- What do you see?

- Whiteness. Pure whiteness.

You're my best friend, Jerry Smith.

I love doing cocaine with you.

Whoa... I love doing cocaine

with you too, Johnny Depp!

Haven't we spent enough

time on you?

I'm performing surgery...

but not on a horse,

on a human!

That's great, Beth! You always wanted to

be a real surgeon.

I am a real surgeon.

- Ahh--uh...Summer's turn!

- Finally!

I don't see anything.

Well, you should select a

different timeline,

I mean, if your father and I

achieved our dreams,

there's a chance

you weren't even born.

That came out wrong.

That came out very wrong.

Fine, I'll find a world

where you bothered to have me.

We're playing Yahtzee.

- Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.

- It's a fun game for fun families!

Hey, could I get those goggles back

for a second?

Yeah, it's got an almost

improvisational tone.

It's just called Two Brothers.

Holy crap, I am

winning a Nobel Prize.

Come on!

Time's up!

I'm taming a lion!

No, wait, uh...there are film cameras. I

might be a lion-tamer in a movie.

You get the idea.

I work with lions.

Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee,

we're playing Chutes and Ladders.

It seems like when I exist, life gets a

little more, I don't know...predictable?

When two people 

create a life together,

they set aside their 

previous lives as individuals.

Gimme a break! We're not heroes for

having unprotected sex on prom night.

Oh, I get it. Now that you know

you could have had it better,

you resent me

for holding you back.

Now that we know you think the tables

are turning,

we know you thought

there were unturned tables!

- What are you talking about?

- All this time, you've been thinking,

"What if that loser Jerry hadn't

talked me out of the abortion?"

Well now you know, you'd be a doctor.

Whoop-dee-doo.

You'd also be drinking wine, alone in

a house full of exotic birds.

And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht,

banging Kristen Stewart!

You thought about 

getting an abortion?

Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm

the version of me that didn't do it.

- So...you're welcome.

- Yeah, you're welcome.

Yeah, thank you guys SO much. It's

a real treat to be raised by parents

that force themselves to be together

instead of being happy.

Hey, do we have any wafer cookies?

Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking

out alternate lives and realizing

you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad.

You know, me and Morty are having a blast,

We just discovered a show

called "Ball Fondlers."

I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything,

but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse.

BALL Fondlers

- I'm in Heaven right now.

- This might be the best day of my life.

So now what do we do?

That show "Ball Fondlers"

sounded kind of interesting.

- Dad!

- What?

They're having fun in there!

What do you guys want from me?

Every family on this block has to

wonder if they're together by choice.

Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles

to show us for a fact that we're not.

- We'll I'm leaving!

- You can't leave, you're 17!

Yeah, and I'm not pregnant.

I'm gonna have better judgment

than you guys had at my age.

I'm gonna...move to the southwest and...

I don't know, do something with turquoise.

house, where you open 'em, and they actually go somewhere

And you go in another room?

Hey wait a minute, Rick. I thought this

was a commercial. W-What's going on? I mean--

Relax, Morty. Don't-Don't worry about it--

Let's just--just see where this goes.

<i> Step on it, we

all got places to be! </ i>

<i> Call us up, and order some

It's just like Garfield, only

instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield.

Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where uh... where

those Sex robots came from, remember?

- That whole thing? - Yeah...hey, that's

pretty, pretty...that's true.

Hey, Rick, you know, did they use Bill Murray for this?

Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In

this reality, he's still alive.

Oh, okay, was his

name Lorenzo Music?

Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that

voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters.

Which is really strange, because it's the same

character Bill Murray played in the movie.

but then, when they

made the movie ...

Bill Murray did the voice of

Gazorpazorp...or Garfield, I mean.

Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that 

happened in this reality too?

I don't know. Just making

conversation with you, Morty.

What do you think? I-I-I-I

know everything about everything?

Did you really talk me out of

the abortion?

Well, we--we blew a tire on the way

to the clinic.

I think, in my head,

I was doing it all for the kids.

And now the first kid is

going to... do something with turquoise.

What is either code for crystal meth,

or a gateway to it.

So we didn't do the kids

any favors.

So, we should stay together for each 

other and ourselves, or...

Or?

<i> Man. Woman.

And now trunk men? </ i>

We know science has created

men that have a trunk

sex with both male and female partners. </ I>

<i> But we DON'T like the idea

of these people getting married. </ i>

<i> Put a line in the sand everybod-, people!

that gay--uh--trunk

people can get married.

Who needs it?

<i> Paid for by Michael Dennys

<i> Hi, I'm a trunk person. And I want--I-I feel

love in my heart, too. Just like you. </ i>

<i> I want to be able to express

that love, with both a man and a woman. </ i>

<i> And I won't be able to... </ i>

hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial.

Well, you know, Morty, I mean,

You want to sell boxes of cereal,

you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little.

Hey, Dad.

W-w-what's going on?

Oh, your mother and I are

going to be spending some time apart, Morty.

And your sister found out 

she was an unwanted pregnancy.

W-w-w-what?

Speaking of "w-w-what", Morty...

W-w-what should we watch next?

What about this?

Pretty cool,

huh, Morty? ...Oh.

Uh, I thought

it was cool.

I don't give a 

[BLEEP] what you think, Jerry.

Hey, uh...

Y-Y-Y-You doin' okay?

I-I-I kind of know how you

feel, Summer.

No, you don't.

You're the little brother.

You're not the cause of your parents'

misery. You're just a symptom of it.

- Can I show you something?

- Morty, no offense,

but a drawing of me you made

when you were 8

isn't gonna make 

make me feel like less of an accident.

That, out there?

That's my grave.

Wait, what?

On one of our adventures, Rick

and I basically destroyed the whole world.

So we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one.

Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed.

And in this one,

we were dead

So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves,

and we took their place.

And every morning, Summer,

I eat breakfast,

20 yards away from my

own rotting corpse.

So, you're

not my brother?

I'm better than your brother.

I'm a version of your brother

you can trust,

when he says, "Don't run."

Nobody exists on  purpose,

nobody belongs anywhere...

...everybody's gonna die.

Hey, Rick.

I have to make a project for

the science fair this weekend.

You think you could help me out?

- Whatever.

- Well, I mean, traditionally...

science fairs are

a father-son thing.

Well, scientifically,

traditions are an idiot thing.

Morty, I think it would

be fun for you

to work on a science project

with your Dad.

Uh...

Yeah, Dad.

Why don't we do it together?

Yes! You backed the right horse

on this one, son.

We'll get out the crayons,

brew some coffee,

and knock this thing out

in two or three days.

What is my purpose?

Pass the butter.

Thank you.

Dad, I need a ride to work.

Maybe Rick can give you a ride.

I'm helping Morty with science.

- I'm busy.

- Doing what?

Uh, anything else.

What is my purpose?

You pass butter.

Oh, my god.

Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.

Since when do you have a job?

Since last week.

It's part-time at this

little vintage thrift store.

My boss is this really

smart, eccentric old man

that treats me nice

and values me.

Meow.

Can't wait to meet...

this

fascinating character.

Please don't.

Oh. Well, when did this

stop being Jamba Juice?

I've just recently opened

for business,

Mister, um, Goldenfold.

You know my name?

That's disarming.

I also know you long

for female company.

You know, it has been

lonely since the divorce.

Some voids can't be filled

with Jamba Juice.

This aftershave makes a

man quite irresistible to women.

Free of charge.

One never pays here...

not with money.

Nothing to read into

there. Thanks!

Sorry I'm late,

Mr. Needful.

This is my grandpa, Rick.

He was just leaving.

Huh.

Tell me, Rick,

what do you desire?

Eh, I make my own stuff.

So, what are you...

like, the devil?

- What? Sorry?

- I don't know.

Store comes out of nowhere,

all the shit's old and creepy.

Are you the devil?

A demon? Leprechaun?

- Grandpa Rick!

- Hey, I'm not judging.

Just like shoot straight.

I'm a man of science.

Ah, then perhaps you could

make use of this.

This microscope reveals things

beyond comprehension.

Grandpa, go home and drink.

Why don't we do a model

of the solar system?

That's what my Dad did with me

when I was your age.

Oh, okay.

You know, Rick's in his lab,

making cyborgs

and wormholes

and all that weird stuff,

but this is real science.

A man and his boy,

making planets.

Hey, how about we use

a ping-pong ball for Pluto?

And then Jupiter...

Uh, actually, I don't

think Pluto's a planet.

Of course Pluto's a planet, son.

I learned that

in the third grade.

Well, yeah, but you

know they changed it.

Morty, nobody changed

the planets.

I just googled it.

Pluto's not a planet.

They changed it in 2006.

Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.

And I disagree.

You disagree?

That's right. It's possible

to disagree in science, Morty.

Pluto was a planet.

Some committee of

fancy assholes disagree.

I disagree back.

Give me a ping-pong ball.

Um, okay.

I-I just have to...

Go find Rick and go

over my head about Pluto?

No. Geez!

I just gotta go

to the bathroom. Damn.

Oh.

Okay, good.

This is gonna be fun.

- Hey, Morty, let me...

- let me...

let me ask you a question

real quick.

Does evil exist, and if so,

can one detect and measure it?

- Um...

- Rhetorical question, Morty.

The answer's "yes, you just

have to be a genius."

Cute. Your sister's boss

gave me a microscope

that would have

made me retarded.

Ooh.

Oh, boy, Rick.

I'm don't think you're allowed

to say that word, you know?

Morty, I'm not disparaging

the differently abled.

I'm stating the fact that

if I had used this microscope,

it would have made me

mentally retarded.

Okay, yeah, but I don't think

it's about logic, Rick.

I think the word has just

become a symbolic issue for

powerful groups that are

doing the right thing.

Well, that's retarded.

- What are you talking about?

- Apparently, nothing.

You asked him if

Pluto's a planet, didn't you?

- No!

- It's not.

- Shut up, Rick.

- Whoa.

I don't care what anyone says.

If it can be a planet,

it can be a planet again.

Planet.

Planet, planet, planet.

Stay scientific, Jerry.

This aftershave made women

want me,

but it also made me impotent!

A price for everything,

Mr. Goldenfold.

A price for everything.

Oh, my god!

How could I not

see this coming?!

My lust!

My greed!

I deserved this!

This serum should

counteract the negative effects.

Holy cats!

Ladies, let's get out of here.

I haven't learned a thing!

Here.

You can have this back.

You didn't use it?

Sure I did...

to develop this.

It detects and catalogs

all your "Twilight Zone,"

Ray Bradbury,

"Friday the 13th" The Series

voodoo crap magic.

I thought you might

want it so you didn't

accidentally

sell anybody, say...

A typewriter that generates

best-selling murder mysteries

and then makes the murders

happen in real life?

Ooh.

Be quiet.

Don't you want to make sure

people know what they're

getting?

You're not intentionally

selling...

Beauty cream that makes

ugly ladies pretty

but also makes them blind?

I find this all quite

preposterous.

Oh, I say, good sir.

Oh, harrumph.

Oh, oh!

That's beautiful.

You know it's gonna be wearing

you in three hours?

Do I need to call the police?

Here, you can use my phone.

Don't worry, it won't

make you deaf

because I'm not a hack.

Hey!

You think you're fucking

so great!

Stop it! No!

Fuck yeah, man.

Stop it right now!

Grandpa Rick,

I like working here.

- You work for the devil.

- So what?

- "So what?"

- Yes!

So what if he's the devil, Rick?

At least the devil has a job.

At least he's active

in the community.

What do you do?

You eat our food

and make gadgets.

Buh-bye.

WhOops.

I'm sorry, Mr. Needful.

I'll clean that up.

I don't know what I can do

about the ghost lady

that came out of it, but...

It's fine.

Summer, you know,

your grandfather's right.

This store curses people.

That's my business.

Well, yeah.

Fast-food gives people diabetes,

and clothing stores have

sweatshops.

Is there a company hiring

teenagers that isn't evil?

This is my first job.

You've been nice to me,

Mr. Needful.

You respect me.

Please, call me "The Devil."

I'd rather not, actually.

Yes, perhaps not during

business hours.

I told you, I want to

file a declaration

that Pluto is a planet.

Well, then my son's going to

fail his science class,

and when that happens,

I'm suing you first.

I think I know what the "A"

in N.A.S.A. stands for.

- Dad, what's your endgame?

- Ain't no game, sucka.

Why don't we just make the solar

system with eight planets?

It's even easier.

Sure, sure, and why don't we

just burn Galileo at the stake

for saying the sun is round?

Science isn't always easy,

Morty.

Whoa! Whoa!

What the hell?!

I'm King Flippy Nips,

ruler of Pluto.

We discovered you quite

by accident

during routine surveillance

of your world.

You really gave it to those

guys at N.A.S.A.

I was... you know,

sometimes science is

about conviction.

It'd like to introduce you

to a few people

that very much agree with you.

Oh, I...

Plutonians.

Jerry Smith is a scientist

from Earth,

where he's creating a model

of our solar system.

Jerry, tell Pluto

about your decision.

Um... Pluto's a planet.

Pluto's a fucking planet, bitch!

Oh, man. This is definitely

gonna go to his head.

If it's athletic prowess

you desire, Principal Vagina,

I might...

I'll take it.

B-But I haven't even...

Thank you very, very much.

Great store.

Great place. Bye.

Huh. Okay.

I must say, Summer, I thought

your grandfather's outburst

would have disrupted business,

but this is the best weekend

I've had since Salem.

Nice. "Wholesome Delight"

for lunch?

- Is that the vegan place?

- Yeah, I love their soup.

I'm kind of soup-ed out.

Mrs. Tate, is it?

What do you desire?

Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey.

Oh, is there a limit?

Everything's free, right?

Let's just say you

don't pay... with money.

That was perfect.

You pay with the curses, right?

Um... I... well...

But, Mrs. Tate, why do you

want cursed items?

Well, I'm going to get

the curses removed

at "Curse Purge Plus."

You know, the guy on TV?

What?

Have you acquired

creepy specific old stuff

from a mysterious antique

or thrift store

that gives you powers

but fucks with you

in unforeseeable ways?

Bring it

to "Curse Purge Plus."

I use science to

UN-curse the items for cash,

and you get to keep the powers.

This guy got mysterious sneakers

to make him run faster,

but guess what?

He would have had to run

until he died,

making them worthless.

I removed the curse,

making them worth,

like, I don't know, $8 million.

See you at the Olympics.

This eerily intelligent doll

was threatening to murder

its family.

Now it does their taxes.

Everything's deductible.

Don't pay for cool stuff

with your soul.

Pay for it with money.

You know, like how every other

store in the world works?

We're located at First and Main

in Old Town.

Come on... come on down.

"First and..."

That's right across the street

from "Needful Things,"

where you can get evil items

for free!

Diabolic son of a motherf...

We're back on

"Good Morning, Pluto."

And a very good morning it is

for our guest,

Earth scientist Jerry Smith,

who's making headlines

with his bold announcement

that is what, Jerry?

Pluto is a planet.

Well, how about that.

I love it.

Morty Smith.

I'm Scroopy Noopers.

I'm a scientist.

Can I show you something?

Uh, I better not.

Right now.

The center of Pluto,

Mr. Smith,

is made of a substance called

"plutonium."

mines like these suck plutonium

up to the cities,

where corporations use it

to power everything,

from diamond cars

to golden showers.

And the more we remove,

the more Pluto shrinks.

There it goes again.

Just shrank a little.

But a few years ago,

your scientists noticed Pluto

had gotten so small

they couldn't even call it

a "planet" anymore.

Should've been

our wake-up call.

But the rich plutonians

won't wake up,

and they love your Dad telling

everyone Pluto's a planet

because that means

they can keep mining

until Pluto goes

from planet to asteroid

to meteor, and finally...

poof.

Um, a party?

Is everyone in your family

an idiot?

Well, for sure

me and my Dad are.

Well, all you have to do

is get him to admit that,

and you could save

four billion lives.

Yeah, you know, the thing is

my Dad's really insecure.

Hmm. Funny.

Mr. Needful, out of everything

in the store,

you'll never guess

what we couldn't get rid of.

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.

I wish this desk was lighter.

I wish this knot was looser.

Come on.

I don't...

Wait, what am I doing?

I wish I knew CPR.

1, 2, 3.

Oh, Jesus.

What a waste of a monkey paw.

Mr. Needful, how

could you even think of doing

something so horrible?

I'm the devil.

What should I do

when I fail...

get myself an ice cream?

You haven't failed.

People like Rick

are making me obsolete.

I mean, seriously.

I may be "the devil,"

but your grandpa is the devil.

I just want to go back to hell,

where everyone thinks

I'm smart and funny.

No!

It's not fair.

Everyone in this town

got something they wanted

from you... even Rick.

I was your only friend,

and I get nothing?

Okay. I'll give you one thing.

Name it.

I want to help you.

Clever twist.

I learned from

the best, you old fart.

Now, let's go get you hydrated.

Looks like we've got...

haunted boxing gloves

that will make you

the heavyweight champion

in 1936,

and then you'll be

trapped there,

winning the same fight

for eternity.

I can take out the "eternity"

and the padding,

and then you'll have some

time-traveling mittens.

Oh, look, it's Rosemary's Baby.

How's business?

Here's the last

of our inventory.

We're going to file chapter 11

and do some restructuring.

Sounds like code for

"You win, Rick."

That was important

to you, wasn't it?

Nope. Lt was important

to your dumb devil friend.

To me, this was all just a bit,

like when Bugs Bunny fucks

with the opera singer

for 20 minutes.

He tried to kill himself.

Seriously? Holy crap.

Holy crap.

But you know what, Grandpa Rick?

He's strong, and he's never

going to give up.

- Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.

- Oh, I know.

- Everyone knows you don't care.

- So?

So have fun not caring.

- I always do.

- Good.

- Yeah, it is good.

- It's the best.

I'm sure it is.

- Bye.

- Later.

I'm here to pick up

my undead cat and child.

Yeah, uh...

give me a sec.

These are the forms

for the employee health plan.

All right, yeah, put...

put them on my... eh.

I just got bored.

Everybody out.

All right, just one more rally,

then I promise we'll get back

to your science project.

Dad, Pluto isn't a planet.

It's shrinking because

of corporations.

Yeah, that's what that

anti-planet nut job

Scroopy Noopers was

screaming about

outside the Ministry of Money's

Fundraiser.

Are you telling me four billion

Plutonians are wrong?

You said science wasn't easy.

I said science

isn't a/ways easy.

Obviously, that means

sometimes it is easy.

Let's not debase ourselves

with word games, son.

Dad, their whole

planet is dying.

Ha! You called it a planet.

Checkmate.

What's up, Pluto?

Mr. Smith, please tell

my friend here

what you just told me.

Go on.

My very eager mother

just served us nine pickles,

and the "pickles" is Pluto.

My god, the man's a genius.

Um, excuse me.

Morty, what?

Dad, what did you

think about the recent report

published by

The Pluto Science Reader

linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes,

and surface shrinkage

to deep-core plutonium

drilling?

Well, son, what did you think

when you were five

and you pooped your pants,

and you threw your poopy undies

out your bedroom window

because you thought it was like

throwing something

in the garbage?

I mean, I'm trimming the hedges,

and these things are just

hanging there.

Was I supposed to think

the poop bunny left them?

Good one, Dad.

Hey, Morty, you want to

go on a... oh.

Hey, Beth.

Hello?

Hey, Jerry, you in here

being stupid?

Thanks.

Hey, you know, I was thinking,

you know,

I might watch a movie.

I am not programmed for

friendship.

Suit yourself.

Hey.

Hey.

W-W-What's going on?

Um, can you help me do

the stupid science fair project?

Whatever.

Jerry, you must be so excited.

The Pluto-bel prize is

the highest honor

a scientist can receive.

I'm flattered and humbled.

Oh, I like that.

Use that in your speech.

Also, talk about Pluto

being a planet.

People like that.

Your highness, we've captured

Scroopy Noopers.

You animals! Animals!

Ooh, look who's little

journey's come to an end.

Take him to Pluto-namo Bay.

You can't kill the truth,

father.

- What?

- I can see you're confused.

Pluto-namo Bay is

a military prison...

a sort of play on words.

Did he call you "father"?

Scroopy Noopers,

the anti-planet nut job,

is your son?

The young eat the old

if you let them, Jerry.

Pluto is a cold, cold

celestial dwarf.

- It's a what?

- Huh? Oh, planet.

"Pluto is a cold,

cold planet."

That's what I meant.

Knock them dead out there, you.

Pluto is...

not a planet.

Ow! It's not a planet.

Hey!

It's not a planet!

I'm an idiot, and I love my son.

It was a long six hours,

but we've overhauled

"Needful Things"

into the globally-compliant

web 4.0

"E-nomenon," n33dful. Com,

spelled with threes

instead of "E's."

Okay, that's it.

We just got bought by Google!

Mm.

I'm so proud of you, Lucius.

So, how much did we make?

"We."

This is mybusiness.

Security!

You're Zuckerberg-ING me?

I was Zuckerberg-ING people

before Zuckerberg's balls

dropped.

I'm the devil, bitch!

What, what?!

Hey!

- Hey, Morty.

- Oh, oh, hey, Dad.

Um, what... what are you doing

back from Pluto so quick?

Uh... some people just

can't handle the truth.

Especially dummies like me.

Morty, I'm not as smart

as your grandpa Rick,

but I promise never to make

that your problem again.

Hey, Dad.

Nobody's smarter than Rick,

but nobody else is my Dad.

You're a genius at that.

Wow.

That's... humbling

and flattering, son.

Thank you.

What say we finish ourselves

an eight-planet solar system?

Um... I'm just gonna

take this thing in

and get an "A."

Butter.

- But...

- You're a genius...

at being my Dad, Dad.

Quit while you're ahead.

And also, knock next time,

you know?

I mean, I'm sitting in here,

I'm 14...

I got a computer in here,

you know?

Oh, I... I think

I understand.

You're really playing with fire

when you burst in here

like that, man.

I get it. Say no more.

I mean, one of these days,

you know, you're gonna end

up seeing something.

I got it!

Noted. Good night.

How's your pretend

grandpa doing, aka "The Devil"?

- He dumped me.

- Oof. Sorry.

Did we learn a lesson here

I'm not seeing?

Not sure.

Maybe in a much bigger way,

Mr. Needful gave us

both what we really wanted?

Because I was always jealous of

you hanging out with Morty,

and you didn't realize how much

you valued my approval?

- No, that's dumb.

- Yeah, not satisfying.

I'll tell you what, though.

If... if... if it's satisfaction

you're after,

I think I might have an idea.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh, totally.

Let's do it.

# X gonna give it to ya #

# What? #

# Wait for you

to get it on your own,

X gonna deliver to ya #

Hurry up, Morty.

Grandpa's about to un-freeze time.

You really should be cleaning

from top to bottom.

I know how to vacuum mom

and dad, Summer.

I've been doing it

for six months.

Then you've been doing

it wrong for six months.

Oh, my God, is that mildew?

It's not my fault we froze time

on a humid day.

You have dropped

so many balls, man.

Do you ever get scared grandpa Rick

might make me his new sidekick?

- What?! What kind of monster are you?

- A competent one.

Who cares about the things

you guys are talking about?

The whole point of freezing

time was to stop giving a [bleep].

Put a shirt on your dumb dad,

and let's get

this dumb universe rolling.

Let's do this thing.

All right, listen, you two.

We froze time for a pretty long

time, so when I un-freeze it,

the world's time

is gonna be fine,

but our time's gonna need a little

time to, you know, stabilize.

Our time is gonna be unstable?

What does that even mean?

It means relax

and stop being a pussy, Morty.

Uh, I thought

you learned that by now.

It also means

don't touch your parents,

or we could shatter into

countless theoretical shards.

- Wait a minute, what?

- And away we go!

♪♪

Um... did we ever put

that mattress under Mr. Benson?

- Shhh.

- Shush, Morty.

A thing or two about...

Wait, what?

Was the house...

When we pulled up,

I could have sworn the house

was completely trashed.

Negative visualization, Jerry.

Explains a lot

about where you're at.

- Hi, sweetie.

- Hi, dad.

Summer, Morty, are you okay?

- We... we just missed you a lot.

- Yeah, we missed you so much.

Too much to hug you, though.

Yeah, it would

literally destroy them.

Now, listen, why don't...

Why don't...

Why don't you guys go

get a free Sunday ice cream?

Get out there

and get some ice creams.

Here's $500 cash

in unmarked monies.

I'm just gonna put it on the

floor and kick it on over to ya.

- You guys go nuts.

- This better not be a bribe.

If I find a single thing

out of place in this house,

my love of ice cream

won't save you.

I'll get my jacket.

Sweetie, is your shirt

on backwards?

Yeah.

I like it this way.

I'm not stupid.

- Phew!

- Oh.

Man, that guy

is the Redgren Grumbholdt

of pretending he knows

what's going on.

- Oh, you agree, huh?

- It's funny.

You like that Redgren Grumbholdt

reference?

- Yeah.

- Well, guess what? I made him up.

You really are

your father's children.

Think for yourselves.

Don't be sheep.

God, I feel terrible.

Yep, it really makes you appreciate

how fickle the universe can be.

One minute you're falling

off a roof for six months,

the next minute, bam!

Uh, just to be clear,

it was Summer's job

to put the mattress under...

Uh, what?

It was your job, Morty.

- Nuh-uh!

- Yuh-huh!

Actually, sorry, Summer.

I got to back the "m" bomb

on this one.

I remember the conversation.

We told Morty to replace all

the bank's money with cookies.

Your job was to put the mattress

under Mr. Benson.

Boom!

In your face, Summer!

You really dropped

the ball, man.

Shut up, Morty,

you vindictive little turd!

You shut up,

you big female asshole!

Hey, don't shove me!

- I didn't!

- You didn't what?

- What's your problem?

- What's yours?

- Shut up!

- You shut up!

Wh-whoa, whoa!

What the hell, hell,

hell, hell, hell?

Oh, God. Oh, no.

What did you guys just do?

- What did who do?

- What do you mean?

- Wait, what am I saying?

- Were either

of you guys uncertain

about anything just now?

Oh, man, I don't feel good.

- Am I me?

- Am I talking right now?

- I think so.

- Wait, who said that?

All right,

both of you just don't move.

Don't speak, don't think.

I have to check something.

- What'd you do, Morty?

- I'm gonna help grandpa.

What do you mean

<i>you're</i> gonna help him?

I can help, too.

- What's happening, grandpa?

- What's going on, Rick?

Sh-sh-shut up.

Oh, crap, are you kidding me?

Two dots?

This never needs to be

more than one dot.

The two of you made us

uncertain!

- What are you talking about?

- What's that mean?

- English, please.

- English?

Our time is fractured...

You two somehow created

a feedback look of uncertainty

that split our reality

into two equally possible

impossibilities.

W-we're exactly like a man

capable of sustaining

a platonic friendship with

an attractive female co-worker.

We're entirely hypothetical.

But I thought there were

infinite time lines?

We're not on any

time line, dummy.

Look.

Oh, my God!

Are those cats?

I assume they're

Schrödinger's cats.

Or, actually, I assume they both

are and aren't, just like us.

- Is the world gone?

- Is the world gone?

- Where are mom and dad?

- What about mom and dad?

Mom and dad? Get your head

out of your family's ass.

The three of us are lost

in a timeless oblivion.

Your parents get to exist.

They're probably living it up

in some pointless,

grounded story

about their [bleep] marriage.

Cold stone creamery

is the best.

What should we do

with our remaining $20?

You realize they sing

no matter how much you tip?

- Whoa!

- Aaah!

Holy [bleep]!

- What happened?

- I hit a deer.

We... we have to tell

the cops you were driving.

- What?

- This is rum raisin!

- It's still alive.

- Well, do we...

Do I, uh, get, uh,

a big rock, or...?

It's not an armadillo, asshole.

I thought that's what

a man's supposed to say.

It's not like

I could've actually done it.

If we were near a hospital,

I could treat it,

but I...

I think we have to just...

It's okay. This is

just something that happens.

And even if we were

in a hospital, what could we do?

You're a horse surgeon,

not a deer surgeon.

So...?

Well, don't different animals...

Require different levels

of skill to keep alive?

- Oh, God.

- Get the deer in the car, Jerry.

Yes, Beth.

This is why you

don't freeze time, you guys.

It's incredibly irresponsible.

And you did it so we could clean

the house after a party?

Look, there's no time

to hold me accountable, Morty.

Like, literally no time.

Look around.

Uncertainty

is inherently unsustainable.

Eventually, everything either is

or isn't.

And we've got about four hours

to be "is".

- Or...?

- We isn't.

All right, since this time crystal

exists in both possibilities,

and since it's impossible

that I didn't nail this,

I'm probably about

to press this button

in both possibilities

at exactly the same time.

- How do you know...

- How do you know that...

Whatever your asking me,

the answer is I'm amazing.

And away we go.

Huh, what do you know.

It's working.

- Ow, ow, ow!

- Oh [bleep].

What the hell

is wrong with you two?

I-I-I-I mean you four!

That hurt!

That was painful.

Good, I'm glad it was painful.

You deserve it.

I saw you. Y-you're both

all over the damn place.

We've been split for 20 minutes

and your lives

are already scattered

to the quantum [bleep] wind?

What the hell do either

of you two

have to be so uncertain about?

Your brand of zit cream?

Which chair to sit in

while I do everything?

- Come on, spit it out!

- Well, you don't exactly make it easy, Rick.

You make fun of me all the time...

You're always picking on me...

And now Summer's doing it... and

now you got Summer to kiss your ass.

Me?! What about you? You're just as

mean to me because you're jealous...

Could you get more

excited to see me fail?

Because you want

grandpa all to yourself!

All right, all right, cool it.

I see what's happening here.

You're both young,

you're both unsure

about your place

in the universe,

and you both want

to be grandpa's favorite.

I can fix this.

Morty, sit here.

Summer, you sit here.

Now, listen.

I know the two of you

are very different

from each other

in a lot of ways,

but you have to understand that

as far as grandpa's concerned,

you're both pieces of shit.

Yeah.

I can prove it mathematically.

Actually, let me

grab my white board.

This has been

a long time coming, anyway.

Emergency!

Wounded deer coming in.

Three.

Excuse me,

you can't be back here.

I'm a certified horse surgeon,

and this deer

needs medical attention.

- Nurse, please move that snake.

- That's <i>my</i> nurse.

And as a horse surgeon,

I'm sure that you know

that deer have much smaller,

much more intricate organs.

As a vet, I'm sure you know

that a deer

is closer to a horse

than you are to a doctor.

So let's save the measuring

for when our dicks are out.

- It's time to save a life!

- Geez.

That's odd.

This deer's wounded.

Uh, yeah, I was there.

You don't have to rub it in.

I mean it's been shot

with a gun.

My gun.

May I help <i>you,</i> sir?

No, but you can stop

helping this deer.

I shot it before these two

hit it with their car,

and I followed them

when they hauled it off.

This deer belongs to me.

We don't have time

for this, okay?

I need anaesthetic

and deer saline.

Look, I don't know what

the law says about this,

but I took an oath that I would

let no animal come to harm.

Except when sterilizing,

aborting, or euthanizing them,

or also when eating them

at also any meal.

I'm calling my lawyer.

I hope for all our sakes you're as

bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.

In your dreams, bitch.

Scalpel.

So, in conclusion,

you're both equally mercurial,

overly sensitive, clingy,

hysterical, bird-brained homunculi.

And I honestly can't even tell the

two of you apart half the time

because I don't go

by height or age,

I go by amount of pain in my ass,

which makes you both identical.

All right, everything resolved?

Everybody nice and certain about

their position in my world.

- Yes.

- Yes.

All right, perfect.

Sit still.

Arms down.

I'm gonna do this again.

This time be like grandpa.

You mean drunk?

What's that?

You got something to say?

- No.

- And away we go!

And away we go!

- Huh, that's weird.

- Huh, that's weird.

- Oh, my God.

- What?

- Oh, my God.

- What?

- The son of a bitch is gonna kill me!

- What?!

- The son of a bitch is gonna kill me!

- What?!

Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath.

- Don't you get it?!

- Don't you get it?!

The other Rick isn't trying

to merge us anymore.

He thinks he can save his own skin

by using the crystal to kill me.

He probably figures

it's easier

to eliminate one of the possibilities

rather than merge them.

I have to admit,

it was always in the back

of my mind, too.

The difference is

I would never do it, until now.

- Rick, what the hell are you doing?

- Saving our lives!

After he takes me out, he's...

He's gonna be coming for you.

- Who?

- Me!

Aah!

- Whoa!

- You see that? Get down!

I told you, he's a psycho.

He's lost it!

Th-th-th-the time fracture

must have made him crazy!

- I don't know what to do!

- Oh, crap!

I don't know what to do!

Oh, God,

now there's three of them.

We're outnumbered.

Get in the cupboards.

Wait, don't...

don't do that.

They'll know.

Wait, wait.

Think about getting in

the cupboards, but don't really.

Is this what you want,

you sick [bleep]?!

You want to see children die?!

You son of a bitch.

You don't stop living

until I say so!

Michael.

- Who's this now?

- My lawyer.

I'm here to notify you, ma'am,

that in this county,

any deer shot by a hunter

is that hunter's property

regardless of how far it runs

or who intercepts it

before it dies.

It's called Brad's law.

We can't make you

stop the surgery,

but at this point,

you're performing it on venison.

Actually,

I've decided not to eat it.

All this fear and conflict...

I'm sure it's ruined the meat.

I'm just gonna use the head

for my rec-room wall.

She normally works on horses.

Jerry, if you're not gonna help,

get the [bleep] out of here.

I will reach into heaven and yank

your screaming deer soul back!

Jesus.

Shh, shh!

I know where you are,

you creepy old monster.

I know how you think.

Oh, is there where

you think I'm going?

You think I'm standing here?

Well, maybe you're right.

Holy [bleep] now what?

Well, if all of me

knocked out all the Ricks,

and you peed

in all of your pants,

doesn't that mean

that we're all synchronized?

- Right.

- Okay.

So, from now on, whatever we do,

we have to be certain.

Right.

I think I'm certain

we're effed in the "a".

Oh, God, my head.

What did you guys do?

We put you in a dog crate

because you were acting crazy

and you caused

another time fracture.

You tried to kill yourself.

O-only in self-defense.

Myself tried to kill me first.

Guys, I don't expect you

to understand this,

but time breaking twice

means our problem is

two times bigger and we've got

half as much time to solve it.

Well, actually, I do expect you

to understand that.

It's basic math. C-can somebody

just let me out of here?

If I die in a cage,

I lose a bet.

Well, is there some way

you can prove

you're not a threat to yourself

and others anymore?

Oh, for God's sake.

All right, here.

- Give me the time crystal.

- Wh-what are you doing?

Calling myself.

Here, listen.

It'll probably go

to voice-mail

since, you know,

I'm calling myself.

<i>- Hello, Rick here.</i>

- Don't fall for it. It's a bit.

<i>Just kidding! Ha, ha!

You just got ricked.</i>

<i>- You've reached Rick's voice-mail.

- You know what to do.</i>

Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.

No hard feelings.

I know you know I mean it, too.

Take it easy.

Whoa, damn! Look at this.

I'm blowing up...

Three new voicemails.

<i>Hey, Rick. It's Rick.</i>

<i>Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.</i>

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I heard this one.

<i>Hey, Rick. It's Rick.</i>

<i>Hey, Rick, it's...</i>

You get the idea.

W-we're cool now.

Okay, well, we're still not

gonna let you out of this crate.

Fine. I'll just do it myself.

If you could get out that whole

time, why didn't you?

Because I waited

until I was certain

it was what I wanted

to do, Morty.

That's the difference

between you and me.

I'm certain, and you're

a walking burlap sack filled

with turds.

You know, geez, Rick!

Y-y-you're really tearing

into me right now.

You know, words hurt.

- Holy!

- A monster!

Hey, you... hey, quit yelling.

Quit yelling.

What the [bleep]

Your time is all ripped up

to hell!

You broke your time twice.

How did this happen?

Shut the [bleep] up.

Oh, damn.

I'm from the fourth dimension.

I can hear all of y'all.

Now let's just see what we got

here for a second.

Hey, damn it.

Were you trying

to use this to...

Oh, see, you broke time,

and you thought you could

just stick it back together

with this?

How you think

you gonna move time

while you're standing in it,

you dumb-ass three-dimensional

monkey-ass dummies?

Oh, way to go, Rick.

Yeah, grandpa, way to go.

What, you're just gonna listen

to this guy now?

He's got a giant testicle

for a head.

He came here in a bubble.

For all we know, he could be the

David Berkowitz of nutsackland.

Shut up.

Here, put these on.

They'll sync

your possibilities up

so I can bring you back

to certain time.

Y'all are just...

Just... just negligent.

See, now...

Now look right here.

Hey, hey, hey, the three of you,

put your collars on.

- We have them on.

- What are you talking about?

- Uh, we did.

- We're not wearing collars.

Exactly.

'Cause you're being obstinate.

What?

Put the damn collars on

if you want to live.

- They're on right now.

- We did. They're on.

All right, fine.

Summer, Morty, put them on.

- Yes, we're back!

- No more cats!

- We're back in certain time.

- Problem solved.

No more cats!

Oh, you did it!

- You fixed it.

- Yeah, I did.

Now keep those

collars on so you

don't break

your weak-ass time again.

How long, exactly, do we have

to wear these things?

They're really embarrassing.

Well, since you're going

to time prison,

I'd say you can

keep them on forever.

- Time prison?

- Yeah.

Well, I don't know where you

expect me to think

you got

that crystal over there,

but the only way your dumb-ass

assin' ass asses

could ever have on

is if it was stolen.

You stole a time-freezing

crystal from testicle monsters?!

I would've been happy to pay

for it, s... Summer,

but they don't exactly sell them

at Costco.

Besides, there's a larger lesson

to be learned here. Get him!

No, no, no, no!

You better keep back!

Man, this will turn your ass

into a third-trimester fetus

from 30 yards.

Mm.

Isn't there a kitten somewhere

that needs a manicure?

That's right, Mrs. Smith.

Give in to your anger.

Neglect that deer.

Honey, it's gonna be okay.

These men are

from the Cervine Institute

of elk, moose, deer, and stag.

They can take this deer

to a helicopter

and fly it to the country's

top deer surgeon

on a wildlife reserve

across the state border.

Where your jurisdiction ends.

I guess that's the end of that.

There is just one more thing.

According to this state's

veterinarian statute,

this animal

can't be transferred

until the current

attending physician

verbally confirms their inability

to provide adequate care.

You heard the man,

horse doctor.

You have to say

you couldn't hack it.

We did it!

Uh-huh. No, mother... no.

Earth, dude.

No, I'm talking about...

Yeah, with the dinosaurs.

No, if you get to the dolphin

people, you gone too far.

All right, man,

I'll talk to you later. Okay.

You know what they do

to third-dimensional life forms

in time prison?

Same thing they do in every

other prison, only forever.

Why are you doing this?

You think I want to be

an omniscient immortal being

transcending time and space

my whole life?

I got ambitions, man.

Bringing you guys in

is my ticket up.

What if I told you there's a

huge ticket up right behind you?

- You really think I'm that stupid?

- All right, hear me out on this.

You're immortal, right, which

means your life is infinite.

Okay, well, then that means

there's a 100% chance

that you'll

eventually do everything,

including turning around

to look behind you.

I cannot argue that.

Aaah!

Oh, God, gross and weird!

Chris!

You killed my gun!

Summer, Morty,

take off your collars.

- What?

- What the hell are you doing?

Good question. I suppose

the answer is I'm not certain.

Oh, no, what are you doing?

- I have no idea.

- I'm not sure.

Stop it!

Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

I'm really uncertain

about everything,

even kicking your ass.

List... hey!

Tw... ow!

But these arms are vestigial!

Now, you poked me where

an eye would've been

about 6 million years ago.

Come on, let's help grandpa.

Yes! I'm 100%

not sure about anything!

Yeah, totally uncertain.

Beat his ass!

Get him! Beat him up!

- Kick his ass, Rick!

- Die, mother[bleep]!

Ow! I'm defeated.

- What's happening?

- Time is falling apart.

We've got to get back

to certainty quick.

Give me your collars.

Oh, man. Don't you have to fix,

like, 30 of them?

Morty, I have to fix three

of them.

And then there's 31

other versions of me

that have to also fix three,

for a total of 96.

I'm not an idiot.

I know how to be decisive.

- Now hand me that flat-head screwdriver.

- Now hand me that Phillips screwdriver.

- Actually, make it a flat-head.

- Actually, make it a Phillips.

Oh, shit.

Look, I know I was

kind of a nuisance today.

I know it's my fault

we hit the deer.

And I know you wanted

to be the one to save it.

Whatever.

How petty would I have to be

to care less

about an animal's life

than my own ego?

Well, you'd have

to be pretty petty.

But you'd still be

the woman I married.

Where are we going?

One last stop.

Where's the helicopter?

There is no helicopter.

And there is

no Cervine Institute.

But the top deer surgeon...

I'm looking at her.

Thanks for teeing me

up like that.

You better get moving.

These lights are designed

for basic ice-cream work.

They're not gonna last

all night.

I need five minutes.

Jerry, this was the most

romantic weekend I've ever had.

Thanks to cold stone creamery.

You're welcome.

Okay, collars are done.

Put them on.

We're out of time.

It's ironic, huh?

Huh? Wait a minute.

- Great.

- Rick!

What's going on?

The collar.

Oh, the latch is broken.

It won't latch closed

around my neck.

- Oh, are you kidding me?

- Geez, what's going on?

How come our collars

aren't green?

Obviously because someone

doesn't know how to put

his collar on, and one of me

is stuck trying to help him.

Don't blame this on me. You're the

one that couldn't fix a latch.

What are you talking about?

It's not broken, Morty.

I fixed it.

Just put it on.

It won't close.

It's broken.

Fine, bring it here.

Oh!

- Rick!

- Morty!

Oh, really, Morty?

Well, I'm sorry.

I'm not the one who's so [bleep]

uncertain about everything.

You know what

I'm certain of, Rick?

I've really made up

my mind about this.

I never want to see you again!

You're never gonna see anything

again, you little dummy!

You killed us!

God damn it.

♪♪

Rick! Oh!

Morty, where's your collar?

I'll fix it.

I dropped it.

What the hell?

What have you done to me, Morty?

I'm okay with this.

Be good, Morty.

Be better than me.

Oh [bleep] the other collar!

I'm not okay with this.

I am not okay with this!

Oh, sweet Jesus,

please let me live.

Oh, my God, I have to...

I've got to fix this thing.

Please, God in heaven.

Please, God.

Oh, lord, hear my prayers.

Yes!

[Bleep] you, God!

Not today, bitch!

Please, God, if there's a hell,

please be merciful to me.

Yes, I did it!

There is no God!

In your face!

One dot, mother[bleep]!

- Yes!

- Oh, yes!

All right, you know

what I'm talking about.

- Oh, that was a close call.

- Oh, yeah!

I'm gonna do

the cabbage patch, Morty.

- Oh, yeah, do it.

- Check me out.

I'm doing the cabbage patch.

- Do it right.

- I'm doing it, too.

- Do the cabbage patch.

- It's a classic dance.

- Do it. Do the dance.

- Oh [bleep] look at that.

Hey, wait a second, how come you

guys took longer to get here?

I don't know. I think, like,

1/64 of my collars didn't work.

It's hard to keep straight now

that I have 63 other memories

of everything.

Yeah.

But I feel like one

of the 64 Ricks,

like, sacrificed

himself for me?

- Maybe? I think?

- Shut up, Morty.

The last time you felt

something, we all almost died.

You little piece of shit.

Hey, guys, we're home.

Mom! Dad!

Uh, hold the phone.

Where did you guys

get those necklaces from?

Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three.

Am I right?

Are you guys Power Rangers,

but only on one small part

of your necks?

Hey, do those things

need batteries?

Were they included?

Cleanup in the fruit aisle.

Not in a homophobic way, though.

They're just fruity necklaces

is what I was saying.

I'm gonna pee my pants!

- Somebody call the planet of "tron"!

- Doesn't feel so good, does it?

- We have three "tron" people over here.

- No, it doesn't. It hurts.

Seriously, are these

Halloween costumes?

Are you going as motorcycles

with green headlights

instead of normal ones?

Are you dogs?

Robot dogs?

Gosh, you guys are lame.

Are those chokers from the '90s?

What is this,

a '90s nostalgia thing?

Are you guys in that movie

"The Craft" with Fairuza Balk?

It's a good show.

Learning to fly this thing,

Morty, is gonna be really liberating.

You know, you're gonna be free to

go on all kinds of errands for me.

- Cool.

- See that planet right there?

Don't fly too close

to that planet.

Someone will come out and try

to wash your windshield.

Hold on.

Yeah?

Yeah, I have it.

Where do you want to meet?

All right, cool.

All right, Morty,

lesson's over.

We got some business

to attend to

a few light minutes

south of here.

Oh, you still use

south in space?

Whoa! Jesus, Jerry!

What the hell are you doing here?!

What are you talking about?

We agreed a boy's father

should be present

- when he's learning to drive.

- I guess I remember that.

Wow. And you've just been back

there this whole time?

Amazing.

Well, we don't have time to

take him to earth, Morty.

Head for 3924917.

Cool!

Looks like I'm coming along

for an adventure!

Yep.

- This is where we're going?

- Nope.

This is.

You can park in a handicap

spot, Morty.

Anything with less than eight limbs

is considered disabled here.

Well, look at this fella.

Aren't you handsome?

Thank you.

- I'm Jerry.

- Oh, I know you are.

Did you come here in a

spaceship?

I'm traveling with my son and

father-in-law.

W-wait. Are they coming?

Oh, they'll be back soon.

What?!

I don't know how this works!

Help me!

What the hell?!

I know, right?

Oh, what the hell?!

I know, right?

Jerryboree!?

You created a day care for my

dad?

Are you kidding?

I wish I had this idea.

Well, I did have this idea,

but I wish I was the version

of me that owned it.

That guy's rich.

Don't forget to check the

reason for your drop-off.

Trust me, Morty, I've heard

stories from other Ricks.

Jerrys don't tend to last five

minutes off of earth.

This is a totally unregistered

cross-temporal asteroid.

Here, they can romp and play

with other Jerrys.

He couldn't be safer.

Hey, Morty, hang on to this.

That number's your dad.

If you lose it, we're not

gonna be able to get him back.

Don't come with.

It's boring.

It's...

it's business stuff.

What kind of business do you

do in a garage?

You know, this seems

a little shady.

Right, yeah, like nothing

shady ever happened

in a fully furnished office?

You ever hear about

Wall Street, Morty?

Y-you know what those guys do

They take their balls and they

dip them in cocaine

and wipe them all

You know, grandpa goes around,

and he does his business in public,

Aw, crap.

Hey, what's up?

Hey, Rick!

Here you go 3,000 flerbos.

Do you have the weapon?

C-can we please?

This is my grandson, Morty.

Oh, hi, Morty.

I'm Krombopulos Michael.

I'm an assassin.

I buy guns from your grandpa.

Here. Go away.

Ooh! Yeah, this looks deadly.

So, this shoots antimatter?

My target can't be killed with

regular matter.

Nice to meet you, Morty.

Listen, if you ever need anybody

murdered, please give me a call.

- I'm very discreet.

- You're g-giving him a card?!

I have no code of ethics.

I will kill anyone, anywhere

children, animals, old people

doesn't matter.

I just love killing.

You sell weapons to killers

for money?

You've got what the

intergalactic call

a very planetary mind-set, Morty.

It's more complicated out here.

These are flerbos.

Do you understand what two

humans can accomplish

- with 3,000 of these?

- Uh, what?

An entire afternoon

at Blips and Chitz!

Oh, this place is the best.

It's got beer, games, prizes,

and you can never

tell what time it is.

You sold a gun to a murderer

so you could play video games?!

Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend

all day shuffling words around,

you can make anything

sound bad, Morty.

Here, check this out.

Aah!

Roy, what's wrong?

I had a nightmare.

I was with an old man.

He put a helmet on me.

It's just a fever.

Get some sleep.

I don't want you missing

school on Monday.

I want you kids to look

around you today

and think about your future.

Now is the time in your life

when anything is possible.

Spiraling perfectly!

It's gonna be caught

by Roy Parsons!

Roy Parsons is at the 20!

Now he's at the 10!

Nothing can stop Roy

"the Rocket"!

Touchdown!

I just think it's time

to get realistic.

Have you talked to my father

about the carpet store?

Roy?

Had we caught it sooner well,

hindsight is 20/20, Roy.

What's important is that we

move quickly.

I'm not ready to die.

You're not going to.

- Yeah! Whoo!

- Yeah!

Hey, thanks for

the carpet, Roy.

Hey, Roy, you pulled

for the clearance sale?

Whoa. Sh shit!

Oh!

Whoa!

What the hell?!

W-w-where am I?!

- What in the hell?!

- 55 years. Not bad, Morty.

You kind of wasted

with that whole

bird-watching phase.

- Where's my wife?!

- Morty, you were just playing a game.

It's called "Roy".

Snap out of it. Come on.

I'm Morty. You're Rick.

Hey! You sold a gun to a guy

that kills people!

Look at this you beat cancer,

and then you went back to work

at the carpet store?

Boo!

D-don't dodge the issue, Rick!

Selling a gun to a hit man is the

same as pulling the trigger!

It's also the same

as doing nothing.

I love that this is how far

you will go for him.

You want to go upstairs

and cut carrots

and watch a Lifetime original

above a [bleep] alien dungeon!

Your relationship with your

father is psychotic.

Oh, listen to you

relish the idea

that my genius father

is a bad person.

Step out of your

ego for a second

and look at this thing;

it's a monster.

He might have it chained up

so that it doesn't eat the planet!

Right, because your father's

such an altruist?

I once saw him briefly forget

the word for "humans".

He's probably harvesting this

creature's organs.

He's probably racing to cure

its space AIDS.

- He's going to eat it!

- He's protecting it!

- Shut up!

- Shut up!

Whoa!

Unity, this place is a mess.

Oh, it's cool.

The part of me that's the cleaning

lady is coming on Friday.

Oh, my god.

I have a meeting

at the Galactic Federation

in an hour.

Oh, I'll never make it.

Ah, I'll push it to next week.

Unity, could you get

Rick out here, please?

He's unavailable.

He's...

Having sex with you.

We get it. Gross.

Get him out here now.

I don't think he wants to be--

- Grandpa Rick!

- Rick! Rick!

I'm gonna tell mom and dad

about the gagoo

you have locked up

under the garage!

What the hell is your problem?

Grandpa, we need

to go home, now.

Fine. Sheesh.

See you.

Uh, Rick, I think

we should allgo.

Tend to your garden, kids.

I'm kind of doing a thing here.

Whoo!

Grandpa Rick, we're not

leaving without you.

Oh, my god, you guys.

I get it.

You're afraid the big,

bad hive mind

is gonna steal

your grandpa away.

Actually, no.

I think Unity's great and you're

a horrible influence on it.

- What?

- This isn't healthy, Rick.

You know, you're really

up to no good

around here a-at this place,

you know?

You and Unity are like...

like leggings and mid-calf boots.

You think you're great together,

but you're just bringing out

the worst in each other.

Oh, gee.

Boy, Summer. Well put.

Uh, why don't we see

what Unity thinks?

Unity?

I'm just taking a little break

from stuff.

You know?

I need to relax.

Oh, hey, w-what's this on the

news, guys?

Let me turn it up.

In the news today,

this looks a lot worse than it is.

We're really just having a

good time.

- Karen?

- Thanks, Todd.

Up next, are you a concerned

grandchild or just a buzzkill?

We'll tell you how you can

know for sure.

I think you two are a little

outnumbered.

Okay, well, what if

you did it for me?

What if you came with us as a

favor to us because you love us?

What?

Dumb. Bye.

But Rick, Summer's just---

Summer's just a

hyper-emotional, needy little--

What's the word I'm

looking for here?

Uh... Human.

It runs in the family.

I can tolerate it,

but I can't give a crap about it.

Take a hike.

Take care of yourself, Unity.

I'm not looking for judgment,

just a yes or no...

can you assimilate a giraffe?

- You're the worst!

- No, you're the worst!

You don't support this family!

All you care about is yourself!

- Is about supporting you emotionally...

- You've got two children...

- ...but you're unsupportable.

- ...Being dragged across the cosmos...

- ...because it's never enough, Jerry!

- ...By your dangerously ill father!

And you force me to watch it happen because

you'd rather lose them and lose me...

And you don't even know what it's like to be

afraid of losing anything ...Than lose him!

- Because you cling and you cling

- Because you're the child, Beth!

You, not me! You!

- Aah!

- Aah!

- Oh, my god.

- Aah!

Um, first of all, hello.

Uh, my name is Blim Blam the

Korblok.

Second of all, cards

on the table,

I'm a murderer that eats babies,

and I came to this planet to

eat babies.

However, I am also carrying a

highly infectious disease

that I suppose you could call

"space AIDS" as you put it.

And Rick did chain me up so that

he could attempt to cure it.

At the same time,

Rick's motivation

to cure my disease

was not to save my life or

anyone else's,

but to patent and sell the cure

for billions of blemflarcks.

But you know the reason why I

ripped my chains out of the wall?

And do you know why I'm never

coming back to this planet?

Because the two of you

are the [bleep] worst!

You both hate yourselves

and each other.

And the idea that it has anything

to do with Rick is laughable.

I'd laugh,

but I'm biologically incapable.

That's how alien I am.

And even I'm sitting here

listening to the two of you

and being like,

"What the [beep]"?

So good luck with

your shitty marriage,

and tell Rick I'm sorry he has

to deal with either of you.

Blim Blam out.

You know what?

I'm taking this.

How do you--

What is this?

Uh, is there a slow setting?

Best door ever.

Okay, okay. Now make them cry,

but happy crying.

Now make them all make fun of

the blonde one.

Now make them all

do it on the table.

I can't believe you created a

whole show for me.

Now cancel it.

Okay, now put it back on.

All right, I'm bored.

Rick, is there a way for you

to call Summer and Morty?

- I feel bad that they--

- Pbht. Screw those guys.

Ugh. I'll be right back.

Don't waste your brain on

those weirdos, Unity.

They're no different from any of the

aimless chumps that you occupy.

They just put you at the center of

their lives because you're powerful.

And then because

they put you there,

they want you to

be less powerful.

Never gonna happen though,

right?

Never.

Never.

Back in a flash.

Best weekend ever, Rick.

I agree, Rick. Let's see how

long we can go.

Hey, Une.

You got any more--

Rick, forgive

me for doing this in notes.

I'm not strong enough to do it

in persons.

I realize now

that I'm attracted to you

for the same reason I

can't be with you.

You can't change.

And I have no problem

with that,

but it clearly means I have a

problem with myself.

I'm sure there's

no perfect version of me.

I'm sure I'll just unify

species after species

and never really be complete.

But I know

how it goes with us.

I lose who I am and become

part of you.

Because in a strange way,

you're better at what I do

without even trying.

Yours, and nobody else's, Unity.

P.S., I don't know where those

coal miners were

before they were assimilated.

You might want to get checked.

Hey.

Dad.

I, um Jerry and I

were looking for

our weed whacker

and found your subterranean lair

and your alien prisoner,

and he got away.

And I know I sound like mom,

but I can't sacrifice this

whole family's safety

just because I'm afraid you'll

leave again,

so no more alien prisoners

and no more subterranean

excavation without consulting us.

- Okay.

- Okay?

"Okay" like you're gonna

quietly teleport somewhere

- and never come back?

- No. It's your house.

Grandpa Rick, what happened

with Unity?

Who? Oh, Unity.

Yeah, well...

I mean, honestly, we're

talking about an entity

that thrives on enslavement,

you know?

It's not cool.

Fun's fun, but who needs it?

I'll be in the garage.

Unity!

How can I assist you?

I want to talk to

Unity, beta seven.

I know it's in there.

You're classified as

a hostile entity,

and Unity doesn't

want to talk to you.

I know your game, beta seven.

I've met a billion of you,

you little on-deck, in-the-wings

shoulder to cry on!

You are classified

as a hostile entity.

Oh, you're just loving this,

mother--

This isn't gonna shake out

like you think, pal.

Unity's not into

other hive minds.

It's gonna suck you

in and use you up,

and a month from now,

I'm gonna be making out with all

of you in a bunch of red wigs!

Unity! Unity!

Unity, I know you can hear me.

Get out here.

Weapons systems engaged.

Oh, in your dreams you have

weapon systems.

Ugh, Rick, you said we were

going to a movie.

We are, Morty.

All right, beta shit seven,

you just got saved by the

bell, bitch!

Did you get any of that?

It's-a good show-a.

Steve, I just got a weird e-mail.

Did you buy us airline tickets?

Aw, shoot. It was supposed

to be a surprise.

I wanted to thank you for letting

me live here all this time,

so I'm treating the family

to a vacation!

Steve, you're so sweet.

- Thanks, uncle Steve!

- Best uncle ever!

Look out, world.

The Smith family

is going to Paris!

Yeah! Awesome!

Rick, I don't like glowing rocks

in the kitchen trash!

Well, I don't like your unemployed

genes in my grandchildren, Jerry,

but life is made

of little concessions.

I--

You know what?

You're gonna land

on your feet, Jer.

Some company out there's

gonna thank their lucky stars

they hired my little brother.

- Who the [bleep] are you?

- My goofy brother, Steve.

He's been

living here almost a year now.

Are you losing your mind?

Hey, someone's been spending too

much time around glowing rocks.

Am I right?

- Oh, my god!

- Call an ambulance!

- Oh, god! Steve!

- What the hell, Rick?!

Will everybody just relax

for a second?

There's no such thing

as an "uncle Steve".

That is an alien parasite.

- But I've known him my whole life.

- No, you haven't, Jerry.

These telepathic little bastards,

they embed themselves in memories,

and then they use those to multiply

and spread out, take over planets.

It's--

It's disgusting.

- Steve wasn't real?

- He's a real piece of shit.

This is a big one.

Somebody probably

tracked it in last week

on the bottom of their shoe on

a piece of alien fruit.

- Someone?

- Get off the high road, Summer.

We all got pink eye because you

won't stop texting on the toilet.

But uncle Steve taught me

how to ride a bike!

No, "Steve" put that memory

in your brain

so he could live in your house,

eat your food, and multiply.

We could be infested

with these things.

So we got to keep an eye out

for any zany, wacky

characters that pop up.

Ooh, whee!

Whatever you want, Rick!

We're here to help!

Thanks, Mr. Poopybutthole.

I always could count on you.

All right.

There's six of us, and that's it.

Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth,

Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.

Maybe you got the first one

in time, Rick!

Can't afford to chance it.

Dad, why does our house

have blast shields?

Trust me, Beth,

you don't want to know

how many answers

that question has.

Ooh, gosh,

it feels claustrophobic!

Reminds me of that time we all got

stuck in the elevator together.

Y-- remember that?

After "The Hulk" musical?

Jerry, buttons don't work better

if you hit them harder,

and foam fists

don't make you strong.

I know.

Friends make you strong.

I watched

the same musical you did.

Why couldn't I bring

my portal gun?

Why did all the

drinks have to be extra large?

Oh, the hulk.

I just got that.

Just pee your pants.

I did it the minute we got stuck.

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me.

At least when I'm disgusting,

it's on purpose.

Oh, y'all,

we're gonna be fine.

I've always been here for

you guys, and I always will be.

Somebody call for repairs?

Yay! Cousin Nicky!

It's me, cousin Nicky.

I'm walkin' here!

I mean, I'm not.

I'm crouched in the elevator shaft,

but hey, I'm walkin' here!

It's true.

We really do get into some

crazy situations as a family,

mostly when

we're cooped up like this.

Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants

is right.

Let's get some fresh air.

Come on, cousin Nicky.

You heard Rick.

We have to stay quarantined

until we know that there's

no more of these things.

I hear you, Morty.

Back in Brooklyn,

we got a sayin'--

"We're walkin' here!"

Nicky, get--

Oh!

What the...?

Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!

Six, Morty!

There's supposed to be six of us!

If there's seven, then

that means somebody's not real.

But how did you know

it was Nicky?

I guessed. That's why I aimed

for his shoulder.

So we can't trust

any of our memories now?

Nicky was the reason we found

that old Nazi submarine.

Did that not even happen?

Well, of course it happened.

Now that I possess

the mighty staff of rah-gubaba,

the world will tremble

before the Fourth Reich!

This is the last time I ask <i>you</i> for

help on my history final, Rick.

Hey, we got a word for Nazis

back in Brooklyn, pal.

I'm comfortable being

called a Nazi.

You think there's some other

word that will hurt my feelings?

Yeah.

Think before you talk shit.

Rah-gubaba,

help me kill America!

Mr. Beauregard!

After due consideration,

I have elected not to retire.

Yeah!

Oh, thank god!

Now, I believe someone

has a final exam to attend.

Set a course

for Morty's high school.

Perhaps I'm biased, but if

that story never happened,

then I wouldn't still be

the family butler.

Dare to dream.

Wait.

And if Mr. Beauregard

wasn't our butler,

it's safe to say the family'd be

in a <i>hell</i> of a lot of trouble.

No! Don't flashback!

You're just gonna make

more swelling.

- Just relax.

- Don't worry, Jerry.

We called the fire department.

You know they won't come here anymore.

Marmalade is served!

Yeah!

Yeah! Yeah!

Oh, whee!

I guess I take back what I said

about British cuisine.

Take that, Summer!

We're trying to sleep.

I don't want

to go to the dance alone.

Then perhaps you shouldn't.

Aww.

Mr. Beauregard.

- Shall we, master Morty?

- We shall.

Oh, wait,

don't leave without letting

photography Raptor

take a picture.

Everybody stop remembering!

These parasites

are like bed bugs,

and every flashback

is another mattress. Look!

There's only supposed to be

six people in this house.

But there's always been 10.

No!

Uh, the fact

that I wrote this number down

means that

there's four parasites.

You sure about that, Rick?

Begging your pardon,

master Rick,

but I seem to recall

a great deal of confusion

surrounding that number.

All right, there's six of us.

And that's it.

Me, Morty, Jerry,

Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole,

Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary,

photography Raptor,

Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.

Uh, dad,

that's like 10 people.

6, 10, what's the difference?

I just love the number 6

for no reason!

Where's my pencil at?

- Here, Rick! Use me!

- Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!

Yeah, I guess that

is what happened,

but I don't get

why I would do that.

Everybody makes mistakes, Rick.

Why do you think

I have one of these?

That's it.

Photos.

Hard evidence.

You're not in any of my photos,

Mr. Poopybutthole.

Well, what do you know

about this?

You're not in any of mine.

All I have are pictures of me

and my friends from school.

What? What teenage girl

has pictures of her family?

It's not like we're mormon

or dying.

I will admit it's suspicious

that Summer's only friend

is a magic ballerina lamb

that we've never seen.

Summer!

Tinkles!

It's past my bedtime.

Not in never past bedtime land!

Tinkles?

That is su--

Suspicious.

We're always hearing about

this Tinkles character,

- but we never get to--

- Hi, everybody.

I'm Tinkles,

and these are my friends.

See, everyone?

Tinkles is real.

That means so am I.

- Sorry, Summer.

- Man, I'm sorry, Summer.

I was on the wrong side

of the pitchfork on this one.

Okay, look, we shouldn't need

evidence or logic

to know who's family

and who isn't.

I know who the Smiths are.

I've known Beth

since high school.

And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is

hands down my absolute best friend.

Thanks, Jerry.

Beyond that, no offense to any

of you, but all bets are off.

Look, I'm not used to being

this unsure for this long.

I'm just gonna aim for shoulders

starting with the weird girl.

Aah!

- Grandpa Rick!

- Hold still, "Summer".

Rick, that is my daughter.

Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just

think that, Sleepy Gary?

I've known you for 15 years.

Don't make me hurt you.

Rick, these are

our family and friends,

the people we barbecue with.

Have you forgotten

the barbecue?

Wait, why would you want me to--

You're one of them, aren't you?

Rick. You love

those barbecues, Rick.

You <i>love</i> them.

Hai!

Remember it, Rick?

Shut up, Hamurai!

Shut up, Amish Cyborg!

What is this?

'90s Conan?

Remember the barbecue.

Remember the barbecue.

Remember the barbecue.

You know what, Pencilvester?

It took me my whole life

to realize it,

but I love barbecuing.

- You're good at it, Rick.

- Watch me, baby.

I'm like Tom Cruise from,

um, "Cuisine"

or w-whatever that movie's

called where he makes drinks.

Yeah, check me out.

I'm like Tom Cruise

from "Cuisine".

Yeah.

Is that what it's called?

"Cuisine"?

Wow!

Hey, everybody.

Let's give it up

for the grillmaster Rick!

Rick!

Rick! Rick!

Wait.

Noooooo!

Shoot. Now look.

It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page.

Can you find me?

Check out

all these zany characters.

We'll be right back

after these messages.

I think you should

put down the gun

and we should get you

to a doctor.

What do you say we take down

these blast shields?

- Yeah.

- I can't do that, Sleepy Gary.

All right,

everybody listen to me.

I don't know

if any of you guys are real,

but this house has been infested

with fake loved ones

that spread

through fake memories,

and our planet will be destroyed

if they get out.

But, Rick, even you have to admit

you do tend to overreact to stuff.

You guys, we got to hurry.

I just got back from Walmart.

They're selling Nintendo 3DS

systems for $149.99 on sale,

plus every time you buy one,

you get a $50 gift card.

Brings the total price down

to $110 after tax.

Now, listen, we can flip

those sons of bitches

for 230 bucks apiece easy!

They're all limited-edition

"Zelda" ones.

Hurry! Hurry!

Come with me!

We can be rich,

and we also all get to keep one

and we can play

Nintendo games!

Nintendo, give me free stuff.

Okay, yes,

I definitely remember doing that,

but also,

I would never do that.

Don't overreact, Rick.

- Sleepy Gary, a word?

- Sure, Jerry.

Rick, keep a level head, okay?

'Cause I'll tell you a secret

about Frankenstein--

He's actually

Frankenstein's monster.

Sleepy Gary, my head is filled

with memories of our friendship.

I'm convinced that you're Beth's

husband and I'm your friend,

but if those memories

can't be trusted, then...

Jerry, just say it.

Sleepy Gary,

how do we know <i>I'm</i> real?

Jesus, Jerry.

No, you're real.

Hey, look at me.

Now, I don't know

which way is up out there,

but I know us,

and you're real, Jerry.

Remember our vacation?

They're filming that new

"Star Wars" movie down the coast.

- Should we check it out?

- Sure. Why not?

Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.

I'd like that.

What are we doing?

I don't give a damn

what else happens out there.

You and I

are going to survive this.

Okay.

Hey, we agreed.

Never in the house.

That's a cool watch there, Rick.

Can I check it out?

Uh, no thank--

Okay.

Trying to figure out how to

lower the blast shields, huh?

Anybody here

think it's suspicious

that a lot of people in here

can't wait to get <i>out</i> of here?

Ah, you're paranoid, Rick.

You've been paranoid since 'nam.

So, what are you gonna do

when you rotate back

to the world, Frankenstein?

Shi-i-i-i-t.

I'mma bust a--

No!

Get out of my head, parasite!

- No!

- Drop it.

Give me the gun, Frankenstein!

Give it back!

Yeah!

Frankenstein!

Is anyone here even real?

Am I the only real person

on Earth?!

Maybe.

Or maybe, just maybe,

we're all real.

You know me.

I'm Reverse Giraffe.

I have a short neck and legs.

- I went to college with Hamurai.

- Hai!

I saved Ghost in a Jar's life

in Vietnam.

- Boo rah!

- And, Beth, how many times

have I been a shoulder

for you to cry on?

Too many.

Okay,

so maybe we're just all fake.

That don't make no sense!

Or maybe there's only one

deceiver here--

The person that

keeps telling us

the path to salvation

is being held prisoner

and mistrusting each other.

Hey, don't blame me!

I tried to shoot Summer

10 minutes ago!

I know we all have

beloved memories of Rick,

but are we really

supposed to believe

that a mad scientist inventor

with a flying car

just showed up on our doorstep

after being gone for years?

Yeah, you know, he does

have a lot of really weird,

made-up sounding catchphrases.

Wubba lubba dub dub!

Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch!

And that's the wa-a-a-a-y

the news goes.

Hit the sack, Jack.

Uh-oh!

Somersault jump.

AIDS!

And that's why I always say

shum shum shlippedy dop!

Grassss tastes bad-ah.

No jumpin' in the sewer.

Burger time!

Rubber baby baby bunkers!

Lick, lick, lick my balls!

Yeah!

Say that all the time.

That's a fake-ass catchphrase

right there.

Yeah, don't forget

his incredibly vague back story.

Beth, I'm your father!

Oh, are you, dad?

Are you?

Rick, if you want

to prove you're real,

just do what any of the rest

of us would do and--

And-- and open the blast shields

and let us the hell out of here!

Why don't you make me,

implausibly naive pubescent boy

with an old Jewish

comedy writer's name?

Ooh! Ooh!

Ooh! Ooh!

In your face!

Give me the gun.

I'm not doing this

in front of Pencilvester.

Bring him to the garage.

You listen to me, you

son of a bitch parasite scum.

We could either do this

the easy way or the hard way.

You know, y-y-y--

Do you want to live?

Then open

the blast shield doors.

Shut up, Morty,

you brainwashed, little turd

that might not even be real

because I'm brainwashed, too.

You know, Rick,

this isn't easy for us.

You know, w-we all remember you

as a friend.

Oh, oh, oh, really?

Well, I remember you as a whiny,

little piece of shit, Morty!

- Oh-- oh, yeah?

- Yeah!

I've got about a

thousand memories

of your dumb, little ass and

about six of them are pleasant.

The rest is annoying garbage.

So why don't you do us both

a favor and pull the trigger?

Do it!

Do it, mother[bleep]!

Pull the [bleep] trigger!

Oh, wow.

Baby wizard was a parasite?

He set me up with my wife.

What the hell?

I figured it out, Rick!

The parasites can only create

pleasant memories.

I know you're real because I have

a ton of bad memories with you!

♪ These memories that we have ♪

♪ These memories

that we cherish ♪

♪ I wish that we can go back

Holy crap, Morty, you're right.

Isn't that what you were trying to

make me understand by yelling at me?

Well, yeah, duh-doy.

Took you long enough.

Now let's go, Morty.

We got a lot of friends

and family to exterminate.

Everybody remain calm!

This is gonna take some explaining.

We need to kill everyone that

we can only remember fondly.

Who's got a bad memory

about Mrs. Refrigerator?

I-I-- everyone has

bad memories of me.

You remember that one time?

Ooh, man,

we couldn't stop screaming.

Uh, roller coasters aren't bad,

Mrs. Refrigerator.

They're thrilling.

And you've been a perfect

companion to me my entire life.

The jig is up!

Get me out of here.

Get me out of here!

Aah!

Oh [bleep]!

Everybody back!

If you're not a parasite,

you have nothing to fear.

So what about Summer?

Why am I always your go-to?

- Never go in my room again.

- I didn't!

She's real.

She's my bitch of a sister.

Nice.

Mom, are you driving me to--

Hmm?

Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?

Oh, my god.

Are you drunk?

What are you?

- My wife coach?

- Your what?

Oh! God!

Oh. Oh, my gosh.

- Oh! God! Mom!

- Sweetheart, are you okay?

- I didn't mean to--

- I'm gonna have a bruise!

- It's picture day!

- It's not-- don't overreact.

I can clean it up.

I want the police to take me!

Morty, give a gun to the lady

that got pregnant with me

too early

and constantly makes it

our problem.

Thank you, sweetie.

Beth, Beth, please!

I thought it was too

good to be true

that we'd have

compatible kidneys.

Come on, man.

Haven't we ever had

an uncomfortable silence

or an awkward fart

on a road trip?

Come on, Pencilvester.

Give me anything.

Rick, I'm Pencilvester.

Listen to that name.

You can't kill me.

You're right.

Kill Pencilvester.

Summer, I've always loved you!

Yep.

- Oh, my god!

- I thought you went to a concert!

We forgot the tickets!

Why in the kitchen?!

I do it everywhere!

Stop shaming me!

You're not the victim here!

I hate you, and I was thinking

about your friend Grace!

Aaaaaah!

Ah. Master Rick.

Remember when you

<i>weren't going to shoot me?</i>

I guess <i>I</i> did <i>the Butler</i>!

Ha ha!

Does--

Does that scan?

Oh, I get it.

It's a play

on "The Butler did it."

Thanks, Ghost in a Jar.

You always were good at pointing

out potentially obscure comedy.

You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary.

Don't worry.

I have a plan.

If we can get to my boat,

there's a--

No. No!

Just send me to Gary.

I want to be with Gary.

Oh, god.

Whoa.

What the hell?

Look out for that homeless guy!

Open the door!

Open the door!

There isn't time!

Just run!

Get out here and help me!

They say you shouldn't do that!

Just run!

Ugh. Sorry, Jerry.

You're real.

I'm a parasite!

Yeah, but you're real.

Uh, uh, I need time

to forget about Sleepy Gary.

Me, too.

From now on,

let's all be careful

to wash our hands when

we get back from outer space.

That goes for everyone.

This is depressing.

We killed every good person

in the house.

<i>We're</i> what's left?

What a family.

At least we're real, Jerry.

We're <i>real.</i>

Ricky ticky tavi!

Ooh, whee!

Amen to that.

Now, this little Poopypants

Will somebody

pass me a pork chop?

Huh.

Is-- is something wrong, Beth?

Ow!

Oh, my god!

- No, Beth!

- Oh [bleep]!

Wait, but I--

- Oh, Beth! Why?!

- I need an ambulance!

There's been a shooting.

My wife shot...

Uh, my-- my wife shot

a long-time family friend.

Why?

Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh,

my god, Mr. Poopybutthole.

- I-I thought--

- Keep breathing!

- Oh, god. What's happening?

- Look at me!

Look at me!

Don't-- don't fall asleep!

Is-- is this what

bleeding to death is?

Oh, whee.

Is this how I die?

Oh, geez!

Oh, my god!

Why would you do this, Beth?

It's not supposed to hurt.

I-I thought...

Ooh, whee.

Oh, he-- he's looking

Listen, Beth,

I made a similar mistake

years ago,

but, you know,

on a planetary scale.

- He's not pressing charges.

I mean, that's got to be

the "you shot me" equivalent

of not being mad.

- Can he have visitors?

- He'd like to be alone.

He told me

Help!

We should go get him.

I hope I can call on you and

Rick again if I need you, Morty.

Sure thing.

And I--

I was kind of hoping that I

could get a selfie with you?

Actually, if you try to

tell anyone what happened here,

we'll deny it

and probably worse.

Understood.

D-i-i-i-i-ie!

Oh, no, no, no!

Why didn't <i>he</i> turn into a snake?

Geez, I can't believe we found

a version of Earth

movie franchise.

I can't believe the things

this reality considers PG-13.

- Yeah. I-I'm pretty jealous.

- Don't be, Morty.

There's pros and cons to

every alternate timeline

It's got giant, telepathic

spiders, 11 9/11s,

- Shut up!

Oh, great.

Oh, boy.

W-what's wrong, Rick?

Is it the quantum carburetor

"Quantum carburetor"?

Jesus, Morty.

You can't just add

Sci-Fi word to a car word

Huh, looks like something's wrong

The battery, Morty.

Be right back, Summer.

Stay put,

Oh, man.

Where are we, Rick?

Morty, remember

eight seconds ago

when when you said,

"Go inside what?"

And I said, "The battery"?

And then we showed up here,

and I wasn't like,

"Whoa, this is unexpected.

This is not what I was

expecting, Morty.

- What a perplexing mystery this is."

- All right, all right.

We're inside the battery.

I get it.

- You don't have to bust my balls.

- Huh, this isn't right.

This pipe's supposed

to be sending

20 terawatts of juice

up to the engine, Morty.

Instead we've got... zero?

Now what

are these people doing?

W-w-w-whoa, people?

It's time for some

hands-on engine repair.

- All right, Morty, hold on to something.

- Whoa!

Holy crap!

I thought we were inside

your car battery, Rick.

T-t-this is like a whole

p-planet or something.

Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud

of this bad boy.

Check it out.

I put a spatially tessellated void

inside a modified temporal field

until a planet developed

intelligent life.

I then introduced that life

to the wonders of electricity,

which they now generate

on a global scale.

And, you know, some of it goes

to power my engine

and charge my phone and stuff.

You have a whole planet sitting

around making your power for you?

That's slavery.

It's society.

They work for each other, Morty.

They pay each other.

They buy houses.

They get married

and make children

that replace them when they get

too old to make power.

That just sounds like slavery

with extra steps.

Ooh-la-la, someone's

gonna get laid in college.

It appears we are

being revisited

by the alien known as Rick,

who once gave our world

the gift of gooble box

technology,

which, when stomped on,

generates electricity,

powering our homes

and businesses,

improving our daily lives,

while safely removing

the dangerous waste power

to a special disposal volcano.

But why has Rick returned?

And what will he say

when he hears the big news?

Let's find out.

You need to tell these people

they're in a battery, Rick.

It's messed up.

There's caterers down there.

Th-th-they're setting up

chafing dishes.

Would you relax, Morty?

There's nothing dishonest

about what we're doing.

Now slap on these antennae.

- These people need to think we're aliens.

- What? Why?

Obviously you really

know nothing about car repair.

Wait for the ramp, Morty.

They love the slow ramp.

Really gets their dicks hard

when they see this ramp

just slowly extending down.

Greetings!

Morty, you got

to flip them off.

I told them it means

"Peace among worlds."

How hilarious is that?

Coming through.

Two real aliens walking

through here.

Rick, our alien friend.

Uh, Mr. President,

um, couldn't help but notice

that you were having problems

generating power.

That's correct.

We've evolved.

Our most brilliant scientist,

Zeep Xanflorp,

has developed

a source of energy

that makes gooble boxes

obsolete.

I would love to see it.

[Bleep] you.

What did you say to me?!

"[Bleep] you."

Y-you told me

it means "much obliged".

Oh. Right.

Uh, b-blow me.

No, no, no.

Blow <i>me</i>.

Zeep, you have an honored guest

from beyond the stars.

I said 12 quantum stabilizers,

not 11.

Fix it or it's your ass.

Chris, I'm in the middle

of something.

Zeep, is Rick--

The alien.

Rick the alien.

Rick the alien...

Really?

You're gonna pull that move?

I guided

your entire civilization.

Your people have

a holiday named Ricksgiving.

They teach kids

about me in school.

I dropped out of school.

It's not a place

for smart people.

Ohhhh, snap!

Listen to me,

you arrogant little--

R-Rick was hoping

to see your new energy source.

I think he could learn

a lot from you, Zeep.

Fine.

It's hard for people to grasp,

but inside that container is

an infinite universe

with a planet capable of generating

massive amounts of power.

I call it a miniverse.

Dumb name.

- Excuse me?

- Nothing.

I mean, it's hard

for us to comprehend all this.

Would it be possible

for us to get some kind of tour

of your miniverse

from the inside?

This isn't a [bleep]

chocolate factory.

I don't have time.

Didn't you say time goes

more slowly in the miniverse

relative to the real world?

Yes, Chris.

Thanks for reminding me of that.

Great president.

All right, let's go.

Whoa-oh!

Hold on to something.

I put an unbounded vacuum

inside a temporal field

until a world developed.

I then introduced

the people of this world

to the wonders of electricity

in the form of a device

I call a flooble crank.

What they don't know is

that 80% of every crank's

energy output gets channeled

out of the miniverse

to be used by us.

No more gooble boxes.

I got to tell you, Zeep,

with no disrespect,

I really think what

you're doing here is unethical.

- It's not cool.

- What?!

Y-y-you got the people

on this world slaving away

making your power.

I mean,

that's what I call slavery.

No, no, no,

they work for each other

in exchange for money,

which they then--

Well, that just sounds like

slavery with extra steps.

Eek barba dirkle, somebody's

gonna get laid in college.

Rick, a word?

What the hell was that?

I know.

"Eek barba dirkle"?

That's a pretty

[bleep] up "ooh-la-la".

No, what are you doing

telling this guy

that his miniverse is

unethical?

Do you not see

the hypocrisy here?

Holy crap.

You're right, Morty.

Hypocrisy.

Somewhere on this planet,

there's got to be

an arrogant scientist prick on the

verge of microverse technology,

which would threaten to make

Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

forcing Zeep to say

microverses are bad,

at which point he'll realize

what a hypocrite he's being,

his people will go back to

stomping on their gooble boxes,

and you and I will be

on ice cream street, baby!

Eating that mother[bleep]

ice cream!

Slurping, slurping,

slurping it up.

Wh-wh-why are you making

that face?

Holy [bleep]!

It's me.

I've convinced the people of

this planet that I'm a traveler

from another world.

You don't think that's

overdoing it a little?

I mean, you could achieve

the same effect

with a pair of--

Never mind.

You know what?

I shouldn't be so critical.

I'm an alien.

Places, please.

We're about to land.

Too fast.

<i>Law enforcement

It was all my fault.

W-w-w-what?

No!

<i>All of you have loved ones.</i>

And if you continue

to turn your flooble cranks,

I will bring you

other great alien advancements.

- Hey, uh, let me ask you something.

- Yes?

Any of your, uh, scientists

working on anything new?

All of them.

That's their job.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But I mean, like, energy-wise.

Anyone working on, say,

a little universe in a box?

How do you know about that?

It's top secret.

So remember-- a crank

a day is not nearly enough.

Crank it.

I told them this means

"Peace among worlds".

- How hilarious is that?

- Re-really funny, Zeep.

Hey, Zeep, the fake president

of your fake world

has something fake important

to show you.

It's not much now,

but once I learn to accelerate

the temporal field,

I'll be able to interact

with any sentient life

that evolves and introduce them

to the wonders of electricity

via a pulley-based device

I call a blooble yank.

But what

they won't know is--

You'll be taking

most of their energy.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I get it.

It's showtime.

You do realize this will make

the flooble crank obsolete?

This is wrong, Kyle.

What you're doing is wrong.

You're basically--

This is slavery.

You're talking about creating

a planet of slaves.

- Told you, Zeep.

- Oh, they won't be slaves.

They'll work for each other

and pay each other money.

That just sounds like slavery

with ex... tra... steps.

- What?

- Wait a minute.

Did you create my universe?

Is my universe a miniverse?

- Microverse!

- Uh, teenyverse.

Ugh!

You bastard!

Much obliged.

- What the hell is happening?

- This is healthy, trust me.

You're my battery, mother[bleep].

That's all you are.

I made you.

Your microverse sucks!

And your miniverse is the size

of a [bleep] lobster tank!

It's whack!

Are they not really aliens?

Nah, they're just a couple of crazy,

wacky scientists, you know?

So he made a universe,

and that guy is

from <i>that</i> universe.

And that guy made a universe.

And that's the universe

where I was born.

Where my father died.

Where I couldn't make time

for his funeral

because I was working

on my universe.

- I made you!

- Yeah.

Science, huh?

Ain't it a thing.

You know, one time,

Rick sh-- accidentally shot

his laser pistol

right through my hand.

You know, I mean, like,

old-lady science, you know?

She's a real--

You got to hang on tight,

you know?

Because she-- she'll--

She bucks pretty hard.

Ooh, boy, what--

Oh, my God, no!

- Teenyverse.

- Teenyverse.

Come on, come on, come on.

Pterodactyl!

Asshole!

When I get

out of this teenyverse,

I'm gonna smash it to pieces

with you in it.

Yeah, well, when I get

out of this teenyverse,

I'm gonna get out of

the surrounding miniverse

and then the microverse

around that, and guess what?

Don't make things worse, Rick!

Uh, he's not gonna destroy

your universe.

You know, we--

We need it to start our car.

That's what you used

my universe for?

To run your car?

Yeah, but don't

flatter yourself.

There's always AAA,

you [bleep] [bleep]sucker!

What's he doing?

What's he crafting?

I can craft stuff, too, pal!

Just like I crafted

your reality!

You crafty son of a--

Ow!

I crafted the guy that created

the planet you're standing on!

Yeah, and I made the stars that became

the carbon in your mother's ovaries!

I didn't ask to be born!

All right, that's it!

I'm out.

I-I'm gonna go

into the wilderness,

and I'm gonna make a new life for

myself among the tree people.

- It can't be worse than this.

- Sure. Okay, Morty.

Just be back before sundown

or the tree people will eat you.

That's a myth!

W-w-why are you trying

to start a myth?

It's a prehistoric planet, Morty.

Someone has to bring

a little culture.

And it certainly can't be someone

whose entire culture powers

my brake lights!

Go, go, go!

Oh, my God.

Oh, God.

What are we going to do now?

<i>I am unable

to destroy this army.</i>

<i>To clarify, I am quite able

to destroy this army,</i>

- <i>but you will not permit it.</i>

- Correct.

<i>You also refuse to authorize

emotional countermeasures.</i>

If you're talking

about the melting ghost babies,

yes, please, no more of that.

<i>Confirmed.</i>

<i>I am currently constructing

a security measure</i>

<i>in compliance

with your parameters.</i>

<i>But I do want to say

You know you're

<i>My function is

to keep Summer safe,</i>

<i>not keep Summer being,

<i>That's you.

Hey, that's my deer!

Aaaaaaah!

Raah!

I hope your God is

as big a dick as you.

My God's the biggest dick

that's never existed.

Why do you think I'm even here?

You're here

because you created

someone smarter than you.

Oh, I thought we were both here because

I created a universe of idiots.

Kalo kada sha la.

Holy shit.

Morty?

I haven't seen you in months.

You're leading the tree people?

Huh.

That's a step up.

We have no leaders.

We follow

only the will of the forest.

Ooh. Wow.

- Gaaaaay.

- That is pretty gay.

You two call yourselves

geniuses,

but you have spent

this time learning nothing.

Come with me into the forest.

There is something

I wish to teach you.

This is ku'ala,

the spirit tree.

For generations,

it has guided the--

You have to get us

the [bleep] out of here.

These people are

backwards savages.

They eat every third baby

because they think

it makes fruit grow bigger.

Everyone's gross, and they all

smell like piss all the time.

I m-- I miss my family.

I miss my laptop.

I masturbated to an extra-curvy

piece of driftwood the other day!

Look, I don't care

what it takes.

You two are putting aside

your bull[bleep],

and you're working together

to get us back home.

No can do, Morty.

I just can't.

I just don't see how I can--

Ro ro dah no gah!

You're smart.

You'll figure it out.

You have 10

seconds to get out of the ship!

10, 9...

All right, not bad.

I guess you're

okay, wrap it up.

You guys are the [bleep] worst!

Your gods are a lie!

[Bleep] you, [bleep] nature,

Yes! You did it!

Yes!

Hey, uh, how about that drink?

Sure, I just need to go grab

my wallet from inside my ship.

Isour wallet in your ship?

That's where the transporter is,

too, so why don't we come with?

It's cool.

I'll be back in a sec.

You know how long a second can

take in a microverse?

Oh!

Run, Morty!

That asshole's willing to risk everything

he cares about just to defeat me!

He's psychotic!

- Morty, hop on my back.

- Why?

Go, go Sanchez ski shoes.

Aaaaaah!

...Eight...

Aaaah!

Oof!

Hold still.

Oh, hey, guys. I just

finished cooking us a feast.

Aaaah!

Holy--

- You monster!

- Whoa. Bad tour.

...seven...

Hey, you got to sign out.

Nothing you do matters!

Your existence is a lie!

If that were

really true, then...

- I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.

- Third floor.

Would you like

to go to dinner with--

Uh, no.

You may have created this

universe, Rick, but I live in it.

[Bleep]

What are we gonna do, Rick?

We're so screwed.

He's gonna get to the

ship and smash the microverse,

and then he's gonna kill us!

Quick, Morty, you've

got to turn into a car.

What?!

A long time ago, I implanted you

with a subdermal chip

that could call upon dormant

nanobots in your bloodstream

to restructure your anatomy

and turn you into a car.

- Oh, my God!

- Concentrate, Morty.

Concentrate and turn

into a car, Morty.

Never mind. Here's a taxi.

Get in. It's fine.

...six...

- Hey, Zeep.

- Huh?

Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.

Aaah!

We did it, Morty.

Now let's get out of here

and destroy this whole universe.

Excuse me?

...five--

Sir?

- Holy hell.

- Sir!

Hold you fire!

What's going on?

<i>I have brokered

a peace agreement</i>

<i>between the giant spiders

and the government.</i>

Thanks to the skilled diplomacy

of this mysterious space car,

from this day forward,

human- and spiderkind will live

side by side in peace.

We will stop bombing them,

and they will no longer use

their telepathic abilities

to make us wander into webs

for later consumption.

Instead, we will work together

to make this world

a better place for all,

no matter how many legs.

What do we do

about the space car?

Leave it alone.

I mean, what did it

really do, anyways?

Kill a guy

and paralyze his buddy?

Not a bad trade

for spider peace.

All right, that's it.

Move out!

I love this spider!

<i>Summer is safe.</i>

All right, I get it.

Rick!

Don't do it.

You quit school, but you

still got some learning to do.

Aah!

Unh!

Class dismissed.

Geez.

- You all right?

- Uh-huh!

What are you doing, Rick?

I'm pretty sure

the battery's dead.

Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?

Well, let's see.

Hey, wait-- huh?

I don't get it.

Of course you don't.

But Zeep did.

He knew that once I got

back to my car,

one of two things

was gonna happen--

I was gonna have to toss

a broken battery,

or the battery wouldn't

be broken.

Peace among worlds, Rick.

Jesus.

Yeah.

Listen to that baby purr.

You were right, Morty--

We really just needed to

be honest with those guys.

All right, here we go.

Thank y-o-o-ou.

See, Morty?

This is what it's all about.

This is why we do what we do.

- Uh-huh.

- Ew! What the hell?

Jesus!

There's flies in my ice cream.

Presidential decree--

All ice cream is now for all beings,

no matter how many legs.

- What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?!

- It was your ship!

- Your stupid ship did it!

- Don't blame my ship!

- It melted a child!

- My ship doesn't do anything...

- It killed it itself!

- ...unless it's told to do something!

- We almost died!

- I don't want to hear it, Summer!

Your boobs are all hanging about,

and you ruined ice cream

with your boobs out.

And don't even try

to deny it, either.

They scanned it out of my brain.

Can I take it back?

There's nothing to regret.

We're dealing with

unconscious, unhealthy thoughts.

Beth.

Now, we scan for Beth's

perceptions of Jerry.

Scan hard.

He's dead to me.

Everything's dead to you.

What?

Nothing.

Read it and weep, bitch.

Does everybody see what I mean?

I think we all see

what you both mean.

Any leads on the vampire?

No, Summer!

I mean, you know,

I think it might be time

that we just l-let it go.

<i>Oh, so, now, you're

too cool for this,</i>

just because grandpa Rick is?

It's not that, it's just

that the universe

is a little too big to care

about something so small.

Aah!

What up, my Helsings?

Who wants to hunt

a vampire? Ha ha ha!

Rick?

How... how did you...

Yeah, I got bored

and then, I remembered,

this morning, how I blew

Summer off, and I thought,

"hey, why are you such

a grumpy douche, Rick?

Go to the garage,

transfer your mind

into a younger clone of

yourself, and get embroiled

in some youthful hijinks,

what's the bfd?"

So here I am.

I'm tiny Rick!

O-o-okay.

Well, it's good

you're here, Rick.

I was pretty sure we

didn't have what it takes

to deal with

a bloodsucker on our own.

Don't short-sell

yourself, Summer.

You got everything it takes.

But it'll still be fun

to do this as a [Bleep] team,

mother[Bleep] tiny Rick!

Yeah! Oh, my God,

Toby Matthews!

Hey, Toby. I'm tiny Rick.

I'm new.

Hey oh... go easy on me.

Ha ha. Just kiddin'.

I like your

straightforward style

and that lab coat's pretty cool.

Summer.

He knows my name!

Why wouldn't he?

You're great!

But, listen, just be careful.

We can't rule anybody out

as the vampire,

not even the dreamboats.

Stop, tiny Rick.

Huntin' a vampire

with my grandkids!

[Bleep]! Tiny Ri-I-ck!

The next step is

to watch your mythologues

interact together

and, uh... big surprise...

It's never pretty.

Here we have garrrh

and zharbidar gloompfschs,

or, should I say,

here we have the way

garrrh and zharbidar

perceive each other.

As we can all see,

this is hardly the real

garrrh and zharbidar.

Which is good,

because the relationship

in their heads is not only ugly,

<i>it's unsustainable.</i>

You may already be

learning something important...

All of these relationships

are different,

none of them are real,

and none of them work.

We are not the monsters

we sometimes see each other as,

because we are real

and we are functional.

That's what makes us

better than them.

We can find solutions.

We can adapt.

We can communicate.

And, most importantly,

we can work together.

Well, it was a tough adventure,

but it paid off...

Our school is vampire-free!

Man, who would've

suspected coach feratu?

You did great, guys. Couldn't

have done it without ya.

You know, we... w-we

should be proud of ourselves.

<i>We killed a vampire

and a gym teacher.</i>

Ha ha ha. Talk

about two-for-one, right?!

So, how, exactly,

is your old body living

in there, grandpa Rick?

Oh, you know,

hyperbaric quantum fluid,

That kind of thing.

It preserves living tissue.

Not that there was much

to preserve. Look at that

mummy! Ha! Ha ha!

And I guess it's time for me to

get back inside the old-timer.

Oh, my God. Toby Matthews

is asking if my parents

are still out of town and

if we can have a party!

All right, way to go, Summer!

What did I tell you?

Ohh! He's asking

if tiny Rick will be here.

Well, you know what, Summer?

<i>Tell him tiny Rick will be here!</i>

And tell him to bring

some brews!

For real? Y-y-y-you

would stay as tiny Rick,

just so we can have a party?

Hell, yeah!

What's one more night?

And who can have fun with this

old bastard hanging around, huh?

Wubby lubby doob doob!

Whoo!

- Tiny Rick!

Moving on. Now,

we have Beth and Jerry Smith

from the planet e-arth.

My heart is pounding.

This is gonna be great.

The e-arth relationships

are simpler.

It's a primitive planet,

so their dysfunctions are oh...

W-wait, what?

What's going on?

Where are the Smith mythologues?

Oh, my God.

Aah! Aah!

Oh, my God.

Secure the cell!

Aaaah!

Uh, hey! You know what's fun?

Our gift shop.

Why don't we proceed

in an orderly...

Oh, dear God, no.

They're codependent!

Run!

Oh!

Oh, yeah, yeah,

you really know how

to sport that color blue.

Really?

You're looking real good.

Oh, my God.

Hey, Morty.

Oh, hey... hey, Jessica.

So, is tiny Rick your

brother or cousin, or...?

No, my grandpa just transferred

his consciousness

into a clone of himself

so he could be

in our high school.

Cool.

Hey, tiny Rick's playing guitar.

All right, everybody.

This next one's coming

straight from the heart.

Making the lyrics up

right off the top of my head.

♪ Let me out

♪ what you see is not

the same person as me ♪

♪ My life's a lie

♪ I'm not who

you're looking at ♪

♪ Let me out, set me free

♪ I'm really old;

This isn't me ♪

♪ My real body's

Tiny Rick!

Thanks, everybody!

This guy's amazing!

I love tiny Rick!

Bad. Ass.

- Yeah!

Aah!

Huh?

What the [Bleep]?

Yeah, I know! What kind

of operation are you running?

Us?! What the hell kind of

relationship do you have?!

Oh, right, blame this on us.

Okay, uh, I can and I am!

Your demonized mythologizations

of each other are cooperating.

Isn't that good?

No. No! It's bad!

You have the single worst

marriage I've ever witnessed.

It shouldn't exist!

<i>You should never, ever, ever,

have gotten together</i>

<i>and I do not understand

how, or why,</i>

you would ever stay together.

Aaah!

Well, this is just

bad couples' therapy.

Totally.

Wait for us!

There's only room for one more.

I'm a therapist.

I'll talk to them.

They're not therapists.

Go, go, go!

There's gotta be a way

to contact my dad.

Let's find a control

room or something.

Beth!

You'll want to see this.

What is it?

It's a small, hinged panel

with a tiny amount

of space behind it.

If you can find one, too,

we should be safe for hours,

maybe days!

You stay put, Jerry.

I'll send help, if I make it.

You don't want to find

your own little hatch?

Jerry, I believe that,

if you hide by yourself,

you might survive

and I believe I,

by myself, have a shot

of getting out of here,

but the two of us, together?

I don't know.

Look, maybe the shrink

was right.

Good luck.

All right, now,

you listen to me.

Oh! Or don't.

Hey! Don't! Please!

Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

Now, I know I've said,

in the past,

that math is important...

And it is!...

But I also think that,

one day, you'll all look back

on being in high school

with tiny Rick and Morty,

who I hear had a great

party last night.

So, class dismissed.

You've got the day off!

All right! Good work,

Mr. goldenfold!

Yeah, get outside.

Read a book.

Put on some sunscreen, Danielle!

Hey, what's up, Summer?

Ooh, nice top.

Thanks. Tiny Rick,

you think you might be

getting back into

your old body tonight?

No can do. Tonight's

the big dance

and Morty's bringing Jessica.

He needs his tiny wing man.

Tiny Rick!

Okay, but if not tonight, when?

I don't know.

When I feel like it?

Damn, girl!

You need to chill out!

This whole thing was your

idea, in the first place,

and, now, you're trying

to rush it along.

Yeah, and you know what?

I like high school.

I like hanging out.

Tiny Rick!

But what if the you

that likes it isn't you?

Oh!

Oh, Summer!

It's just Rick

in a younger body.

What's the... what's...

What's... what's...

What's the...

What's the problem?

Look at his art, Morty.

I've got an emo streak.

It's part of what

makes me so rad.

Why does it say "help me

Morty and Summer!"?

Come on, Summer, that's

the title of the art.

<i>Why was knight rider

called knight rider?</i>

The car's name was kitt.

Nobody rode Michael knight.

You're overthinking it, Summer.

I'm tiny Rick!

Grandpa, I think that,

when you put your mind

into this body's young brain,

it did what young brains do...

It shoved the bad

thoughts into the back

and put a wall around them.

But those bad thoughts

are the real Rick.

The fact that you're old,

the fact that

we're all going to die,

one day, the fact that

the universe is so big,

nothing in it matters,

those facts are who you are.

So you're trapped in there

and you can only

come out in the form of

tiny Rick's teen angst!

<i>Well, Summer, I hear</i>

Toby Matthews isn't

into psycho chicks.

Can't think of anyone that is.

I'll see you mother[Bleep]

at the dance! Tiny Rick!

Morty, you have to help me!

Summer, he's happy!

I'm happy!

I-I-is that why

you're doing this,

you don't want me

and Rick to be happy?

No.

Well, then get

your shit together!

Get it all together

and put it in a backpack.

All your shit, so it's together.

And if you gotta

take it somewhere,

take it somewhere, you know?

Take it to the

shit store and sell it

o-or put it in a shit museum.

I don't care what you do!

You just gotta get it together.

Get your shit together.

Get back!

Wait, for real?

You're how Beth sees me?

Oh, my God.

Turn around!

I said turn around!

How can Beth have

these thoughts about me?!

That judgmental monster bitch!

I'm not taking this.

I want to know where my wife is.

<i>You are going to help me.</i>

No!

Nobody's doing that!

Stay.

What do you want?

Jerrys.

You want Jerry?

<i>I don't even want Jerry.</i>

I want Jerrys.

Waahee!

An army.

An army of Jerrys.

The value of his subservience

is wasted on you.

I will use it to dominate

the universe.

Ah ha ha. Boy,

Jerry must think

I'm pretty stupid, for you

to be this stupid.

Wouldn't it make more sense

to put my dumb-ass husband

in this chair, so you can make

<i>an army of youbadass self?</i>

There could never be

more than one of me.

I'm the strongest,

smartest being alive

<i>because Jerry thinks

you're that much stronger</i>

and smarter than you are!

Okay, ouch.

♪

Oh, hey h-hey-y!

Morty, Jessica, what's up?

Check out the new dance

I made up.

It's called "ooh let me out!"

- Awesome!

Okay, that last part

was really weird.

Maybe Summer's

on to something here.

I don't know.

It was fun.

You want to slow dance?

Tiny Rick, hey,

great dancing as usual.

Moment of your time?

Tiny Rick, this conversation

is gonna break

my heart wide open.

You're a great student

and the fact that

you're an 80-year-old man

in a clone body,

it never bothered me.

But this here is another matter.

You recognize this?

We got a tip

it was in your locker.

Yeah, now, because the

gym coach was a vampire,

the school board is embarrassed

<i>and won't take it public,

however,</i>

they can't have students

killin' teachers.

I gotta expel you

for this one, tr.

I'm sorry.

I just got expelled, Summer!

Oh! So I guess there's

no need to stay young.

My top!

Screw your top!

You ratted on me?!

I'm tiny Rick!

Fine! Yes!

Because I love you

and I'm trying

to save your life!

<i>High school is my life!</i>

Summer Smith is

a [Bleep] psycho nerd

and she just got me

kicked out of school!

Boo!

Summer, I thought you were cool!

I'm sorry, okay?

How can you be such a bitch?

Oh, my God, Morty.

Your sister crossed tiny Rick?

Talk about

self-destructive.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry-lover!

How about a taste

of the real thing?

Jerry!

Ah. Ah. Ah.

Ah ah ah ah ah aah aah.

Not on my watch.

That's it!

Beth, it's me, your husband!

I'm here to save you.

Or my name isn't Jerry Smith!

Aha!

- Yes!

Jerry Smith!

Yeah, here.

- Aha!

Okay, fair enough.

Say goodnight, old man.

What the hell are you doing?!

- Put it down!

Summer, you bitch!

Don't talk to her that way!

She's your granddaughter!

I don't need a granddaughter!

I'm tiny ri-I-ck!

She's my sister!

And if tiny Rick

is gonna be an asshole

to my sister, then,

you know, y-y-you

may as well be old again.

You think you're tough,

huh, Morty?

What are you gonna do?

I'm tiny Rick.

I'm the coolest kid

in your school.

How are you gonna just make me

do whatever you say, huh?

I'm gonna do what real Rick

would do if he was here...

I'm gonna kick your ass!

Ohhhh!

Rick, I know you're in there!

I know you're trying to get out!

That's it, Morty!

Hold him down!

<i>♪ Drink up, baby</i>

<i>♪ stay up all night</i>

listen to it, tiny Rick.

Listen to elliott Smith.

Ugh! No!

Feel what he's feeling.

Ugh! Noooooooo! God!

<i>♪ That you'll never see</i>

oh, God, what is life?

How can someone so talented

die so young?

What is being young?

I'm not young.

I'm old.

I'm... I'm gonna die.

My body isn't real.

Morty! Summer!

It's me! It's Rick!

Regular Rick!

Rick! How do we get you

back into your body?

Okay, listen carefully.

There's a set of diodes

on the vat's control panel,

a blue one and a red one.

Oh, God, what kind

of world is this?

I didn't ask to be born.

I need you to connect

the blue one to my left temple

and the red one to...

Why doesn't anyone

really like me?

Focus, grandpa!

Just put the stupid

wires on my head!

I hate being a teenager!

Ugh! Arrgghh!

Ah! Uhhhhh!

Jerry, you can't bend metal.

Then make a me that can!

How can I do that

while I'm watching you

totally fail to bend metal?

Good old Beth!

The mind of a robot

and the heart of an insect!

Don't talk that way about her.

What?

Oh, it hurts!

Oh, God.

<i>Stop.</i>

<i>This representation

displeases me.</i>

Aaah!

Good lord.

How did you...?

Well, I had a feeling

that, in your mind,

the ideal version of me

is one smart enough

to see you as...

A goddess.

Not such a stupid worm

now, are you?

Honey, when it comes

to the subject of your ego,

I'm Stephen [Bleep] hawkinson.

Ugh, it's...

Never mind.

I love you.

Ugh agh.

Rick!

Pants!

Holy shit!

Thanks, kids.

You figured it out.

Well, Summer did.

Kind of weird that

you were that willing

to sell my existence out

for some trim, Morty.

What?!

Pants!

But listen... I forgive you both

because you know what?

I learned, today,

something important...

The teenage mind

is its own worst enemy.

Oh, I also learned this...

Operation Phoenix is not the

fallback I thought it would be.

I guess it's back

to the drawing board.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.

Put some pants on!

Put pants on.

Grandpa's back, baby!

<i>Grandpa's...</i>

Oh, man, I gotta pick up

your parents.

They have been blowin' me up.

One last swing for the road!

Aaaaaaaaaaah!

For the love of God,

get dressed!

So, what do you think?

You wanna

keep this marriage

going a while longer?

At least until Morty has

graduated high school.

Oh. Mm.

Aha, you see?

What did I tell you two?

It worked.

You know what, Rick?

I guess, in a way...

Already lost interest.

Get in the car.

I've been inside a kid

all day and, now,

I can feel my bones

scraping each other.

Uh, just so you're prepared,

there's a bunch of dead mes

in the garage.

Huh! Sounds like our stories

were connected by a theme.

Not really, Jerry.

<i>Probably a cosmetic connection

your mind mistakes for thematic.</i>

Oh.

Old Rick!

Ruinin' everything!

♪

Master.

Speak.

Coach feratu's presence

was discovered by the humans.

He has been destroyed.

No bother.

The mortals shall soon...

I'm sorry, what did you

say his name was?

Coach feratu.

Coach feratu.

That was his real name,

like his actual vampire name?

No no no no. His vampire

name was balik alistane.

Why the [Bleep]

would he name himself

after a famous vampire movie?

Was he doing a bit?

I do not know, your unholiness.

Jesus [Bleep] Christ.

From now on, no more of

this clever-name bullshit.

When a vampire is pretending

to be a human,

they can just call themselves

Alan Jefferson

or something like that.

It's crazy, right?

I mean, am I being an asshole?

Okay, I feel like

everybody in the room

is looking at me like

I'm the buzzkill.

I'm not?

Good. Okay. Great.

Oh, my g...!

Did you get any of that?

It's-a good-a show!

Don't worry about Jerry.

He's gonna be fine.

You hear me, Jerry?

You're gonna be fine.

Whoa!

Ooh, watch out for that stuff.

It'll stain

if it gets on your clothes,

and it'll send you into

a murderous rage if it gets

in your eyes and mouth. Why

would you keep mutant bacteria

- Not anymore.

- You're overreacting!

We're losing him. All right, fine,

but you're not touching my crisper.

- Is he going to die?

- Don't worry.

Dr. glip glop

is the best in the galaxy.

Hello, I'm Dr. glip glop.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

-

- Aah!

What?

Every hospital claims to have

the best doctor

in the ga--laxy.

It's like those Pizza places

that claim to have

the best Pizza in the world.

What do you think,

they have Pizza contests?

Have you ever been

to a Pizza contest?

- Go in the waiting room, dad.

- Fine!

Excuse me.

Coming through.

What are you here for?

Just kidding. I don't care.

?

Well, this won't do.

- Hey, what are you doing?

- A sequel.

- I don't understand.

- Yeah, me, neither.

We pretty much nailed it

the first time.

Biatch!

<i>Ooh! Ooh!</i>

<i>Ow!</i>

<i>"Man vs. Car,"

the newest hit show,</i>

- where it pits a man...

- Yeah!

Versus a car.

On tonight's episode,

Michael Jenkins fights

a regular old car.

Here we go.

Oh, he's pushing

his way through.

He's trying to fight that car,

but the car seems to have

the upper hand.

Oh, he's got a little bit

of pushback there.

Oh, no.

He just got ran over

and chewed up by the tires.

I guess that's another one

for the cars.

I mean,

wouldn't the cars always win?

?

Samantha, I need to know,

that you understand that

I have a couple of eyeholes.

I do. I do understand

about your eyeholes.

Here, look at my eyeholes.

Oh, my God.

You have eight eye ho... holes.

Ohh, I'm looking through

your eyeholes.

Yes, look through my eyeholes.

<i>I'm the eyehole... Man.</i>

<i>I'm the only one that's

allowed to have eye holes.</i>

<i>Get up on out of here

with my eyeholes.</i>

- Eyeholes. Get them today. Ikea...

- You got to be careful, Morty.

If that guy catches you

with a box of his eyeholes,

he comes bursting in

through a window

and just starts

kicking the shit out of you.

But it's worth the risk.

They melt in your mouth, Morty.

They're delicious.

Dad, I can't believe

you're explaining alien cereal.

- We're worried about Jerry.

- Well, you're 39 years too late,

or, you know,

however old he is.

Is he... is he 50?

Jesus Christ, Beth,

is... is Jerry 50?

Where am I?

Relax, Mr. Smith.

You're in an alien hospital.

I mean, to you,

it's an alien hospital.

To me,

you're just in a hospital.

There's another matter

we need to discuss with you.

Okay.

An hour ago, shrimply pibbles,

the galaxy's most influential

civil rights leader,

was brought to this hospital's

emergency room,

where he is currently fighting

for his life.

My God.

Mr. Smith,

shrimply pibbles' life

can be saved if we replace

his heart with your human penis.

I see. Wait, what?

It's perfect.

The configuration of veins,

the ratio of thickness

to elasticity,

the delicate asymmetry

of what you call your balls,

and with relatively

few adjustments,

your genitals can be molded

into a functioning heart

for the most important man

in the universe.

- Yeah, but... I mean...

- Oh, forget it!

I told you this was

a waste of time!

Have respect, yarp.

The earth man's world

is tiny and undeveloped.

He knows nothing

of the genocides of clorgon

or the tragic events

of 65.3432.23/14.

And even if he did,

he wouldn't comprehend them.

I've dwelt among the humans.

Their entire culture

is built around their penises.

It's funny to say

they are small.

It's funny to say they are big.

I've been at parties

where humans have held

bottles, pencils, thermoses

in front of themselves

and called out,

"hey, look at me.

I'm Mr. so-and-so-dick.

I've got such-and-such

for a penis."

I never saw it

fail to get a laugh.

All right! That's enough!

You guys are talking

about my species.

We understand genocide.

We do it sometimes.

<i>Then you would give your penis</i>

so that shrimply pibbles might live?

Stop asking!

Yes, I will!

That's right, assholes.

Take my penis. Take it all!

And tell shrimply pibbles

that when the galaxy

came calling,

Jerry Smith from earth

didn't flinch!

Hey, w-what's wrong, Morty?

Oh, you're worried

about your dad, huh?

Huh? Oh, no, no, no.

I'm just... I'm just looking

at that lady over there

getting coffee.

What's up with her face?

Is she human,

or is she like worf?

You know,

worf from "Star Trek,"

how he has all that shit

all over his face,

but he's just a human

in a costume, you know?

Morty, uh, let's see what

else is on, huh? Okay.

<i>And now we're back to

"how did I get here?"</i>

<i>The only show

that makes you ask yourself,</i>

<i>"how did I get here?"</i>

<i></i>

<i>Here's our first person.</i>

<i>Oh. Oh, my God.</i>

<i>How did I get here?</i>

<i>Hello?!</i>

<i>How did I get here?!

Somebody, help me, please!</i>

All right!

Holy crap! Look, it's that lady

with the shit on her face

like worf from "Star Trek"

that was getting coffee!

How did she get there?!

Oh, my God, Morty,

how did she get there?

<i>How did she get there?

</i>

Is that something

we should be concerned about?

Just stay away

from the coffee machine.

Calling all Jan Michael Vincents.

<i>He can't be at two quadrants

Hey, Rick, who...

who is jan Michael Vincent?

Oh, man.

I'm trying to remember, Morty.

<i>Jan Michael Vincents

I need a goddamn

Is it important that we know

by making incisions

here, here, and here.

Got it.

Leaving a partial length

of severed urethra

- to be threaded through...

-

Oh, you know what, I got to...

I got to laugh at myself here.

I'm having a little laugh

at myself

because I just realized

I haven't run

this whole decision

past my wife.

Oh. Do you think

she'll be okay with this?

Oh, absolutely.

Beth's automatically

on board always

with every decision I make.

<i>Hey, I'm stealy.</i>

Follow me on my adventure

through this office.

?

All right, here we go.

We're gonna just steal

a couple of things.

Excuse me. Can I help you?

Starting with common

office objects.

Hey, hey, hey! That's my stuff!

Such as staplers and pins

and all sorts of things like...

such as that.

That's it.

I'm calling security.

No!

?

All right, okay,

now we're in the quiet safe room

where none of the people

whose stuff I stole

can get to us.

Now, let's look

at all the stuff we got.

We got a bag of bobbish.

That's eight brapples.

We got a plumbus.

That's 61/2 brapples.

We got, uh, a...

crushed red party cups.

151/2 brapples.

Welcome back to "funny songs."

It's all improvised.

It's very funny.

I need a volunteer

from the audience.

Um, longtime fan

of the show. Uh...

what do you do?

What's your profession?

I am a tax attorney.

Okay, here we go.

Hit... hit the music.

?

? I'm a tax attorney

? oh, geez, oh

? forget about everybody else

? forget about Jesus Christ

? forget about muhammad

? forget about, uh...

All those religions ?

? Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-bop

the end.

Oh, my God.

Oh, that was so, so funny.

- Thank you.

- You're welcome.

Hey, um, security guards,

take him out.

- Get him out of here.

- What?

Get the orthodontist

out of here.

No! Why?

Take him out of the audience.

Kill him. Sic him.

Demons...

<i>Suck his life out.</i>

<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

- Smith family?

- Yes?

I wanted to let you all know

that Jerry is doing just fine.

- Yay! Called it!

- Yes! Whoo-hoo!

That's good news! But, uh,

Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?

Hi, honey,

so, here's the thing...

these guys...

they want to completely

remove my penis and use it

as an alien's heart.

And we just need you

to sign off on it.

- What?!

- Uh-oh.

Maybe we got a problem here

after all, guys. Yikes.

His penis will be replaced

with a sophisticated prosthetic.

Now, there's a wide range

of options to choose from.

They're all in this catalogue.

I don't care about prosthetics.

This is insane.

What do you people

think you're doing?

I understand your feelings,

Mrs. Smith.

Oh, I don't think you do.

I bring my husband in

for emergency treatment.

He's gone an hour.

And now you want his penis,

and you hand me some... Catalog.

It's... it's...

it's... it's... I mean...

Sheesh.

Well, there you go. Sorry.

I know it's hard to understand,

but on earth, love comes first.

There are those that believe,

Mr. Smith,

that shrimply pibbles represents

love between all life.

His fate will determine

the fate of hundreds of billions

of sentient life-forms.

Whoa! Whoa.

So, billions of life-forms?

Hundreds of billions.

I mean, Jerry,

y-you didn't explain

the full gravity

of the situation.

Uh, well, Beth,

I don't think your decision

should be based on politics.

Who could argue

with a wife's decision

to keep her lover intact?

Well, I don't think that's

fair at all, Jerry. At all.

In fact, the whole paradigm

has sexist overtones.

Beth, can we talk

about this privately.

You know, I think

the bottom line is, Jerry,

if you want to keep your penis,

you should say, out loud,

"I prefer to keep my penis."

But, Beth, what kind of man

would say something like that

if the universe needed

his penis?!

Well, Jerry,

what kind of wife would I be

if I did anything

to stand in your way?

<i>Hey, listen,</i>

is your mouth tiny and small?

- Then why don't you come to lil' bits...

- Lil' bits!

where the food is tiny.

It looks like regular food,

but really tiny.

You can put it in your mouth

and eat it.

Nothing gets stuck in your lips.

It's just tiny and tiny

and fits right...

<i>- fits right in.

- Lil' bits!</i>

We got tiny lasagna,

tiny Pizza, tiny pie.

Mmm! Little, tiny fried eggs.

Oh, shit. We got tiny people.

<i>Lil' bits!</i>

You hungry? Come on down.

<i>Lil' bits.</i>

Eat some  shit,

you  stupid bitch.

Just kidding.

You've got some time to kill

before the procedure,

so I assume you'd like to, uh,

use your penis one last time.

Here's my computer.

It's got the alien Internet

on it.

Here's some porn.

And there's an alien towel.

I actually got that

on another planet.

So it is an alien towel to me.

- Good luck.

- Thanks.

What is this?

Hmm.

Hey, wait a minute.

Oh, uh, Mr. Smith?

Uh, yeah, just masturbating!

I forgot to mention,

there are extensive medical

records open on my desktop,

and I trust you

to confine your activities

- to the purely pornographic.

- Absolutely!

Good luck.

My God!

Mr. pibbles,

you just wrote my penis

a one-way ticket

to staying on my body town.

It's the opposite

news with Michael Thompson.

<i>Hey, everybody.

It's me, Michael Thompson.</i>

<i>Today the pope

didn't get killed.</i>

<i>He's perfectly fine.

And he's on vacation in Aruba.</i>

<i>In other opposite news,

information...</i>

Hey, Rick,

what's the deal with this guy?

W-why is his body,

like, sloping off

to the right side of the screen like that? I

don't know, Morty. See what else is on, huh?

<i>Hey, welcome

to "cooking things."</i>

<i>I'm pichael Thompson.</i>

Hey, wait a minute, Rick.

This guy's body

is, like, sloping down

and leaning off to screen left.

Oh, my God,

and his name's pichael.

<i>I'm cooking

a little bit of this.</i>

<i>I'm gonna cook

a little bit of that.</i>

<i>Oh, oh, hey!

Stop tugging, Michael!</i>

Oh, my God! Siamese twins!

They're...

they're siamese twins!

<i>You quit tugging.

I-I'm in the middle of my news.</i>

<i>Oh, oh, it's always about you,

isn't it?</i>

<i>Can you believe this guy,

ladies and gentlemen?</i>

<i>He's got his own news show.

He's got a normal name.</i>

- Hey, flip back to the news.

- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

<i>You could tell our parents

started with naming with him.</i>

<i>It's like, "oh, Michael."</i>

<i>They had that one planned</i>

<i>before they even got pregnant,

I bet.</i>

I don't want to be that girl,

but maybe there would be

less conflict

if they didn't shoot their shows

at the same time.

Oh, summer, you have no idea

how much money

that must save production.

<i>And then they found out

I was attached,</i>

<i>along for the ride,

and they said, "ah, shit."</i>

<i>Well, just  it,

call him pichael."</i>

<i> You, pichael.

You're a  piece of shit.</i>

?

Good afternoon.

I know all of you are wondering

about the condition

of our dear, beloved pibbles.

Which would you prefer between

the xp-20 and the xp-20 xs?

I prefer my own penis,

and so should you!

The brave earth man

whose sacrifice

is going to allow

shrimply pibbles to live...

Mr. Jerry Smith.

Hello, everyone!

Let's hear it again

for shrimply pibbles, huh?

He's a good guy, isn't he?

I've only just been learning

about his accomplishments,

from his march

on flirk blirk square

to his ongoing battle

with heroin dependency.

He's the best.

Um, yeah.

Well, I-it occurs to me

that his heroin addiction

may not have been

a matter of public record.

You realize heroin makes up

10% of the atmosphere

on shrimply pibbles'

home planet.

His planet was destroyed

by clorgon death squads.

He can't live outside of it

without breathing heroin.

Right. I know that.

I just think...

This guy's trying to get out of

giving away his penis!

Today on "how they do it"...

<i>Plumbuses.</i>

Everyone has a plumbus

in their home.

First, they take the dinglebop,

and they smooth it out

with a bunch of schleem.

The schleem is then repurposed

for later batches.

They take the dinglebop,

and they push it

through the grumbo,

where the fleeb

is rubbed against it.

It's important that the fleeb

is rubbed

because the fleeb

has all of the fleeb juice.

Then a schlami shows up,

and he rubs it and spits on it.

They cut the fleeb.

There's several hizards

in the way.

The blamfs rub

against the chumbles.

And the ploobis and grumbo

are shaved away.

That leaves you

with a regular, old plumbus.

I always wondered how,

uh, plumbuses got made.

<i>Hey, welcome back

to "personal space."</i>

<i>I'm your host Phillip Jacobs,</i>

<i>and let me tell you,

I care about my personal space.</i>

<i>Whoa, whoa. Hey.

Who's around me right now?</i>

<i>Who's around me?</i>

<i>Now, why don't we step up here

and everybody get stepped up</i>

<i>and let's get

some stepped-up personal space</i>

<i>up in this place.</i>

<i>Here we go.</i>

<i>We get a one, personal space.</i>

<i>Two, personal space.</i>

<i>Three,

stay out of my personal space.</i>

<i>Four, keep away

from my personal space.</i>

<i>Five...</i>

Get out of that personal space.

<i>Six...</i>

<i>Stay away

from my personal space.</i>

<i>Seven...</i>

<i>Keep away

from that personal space.</i>

<i>Eight, personal space.</i>

<i>Nine, personal space.</i>

<i>You know, I take personal space

pretty seriously,</i>

<i>up to the point that I don't

even care about this...</i>

<i>I'm not even interested

in having this skin</i>

<i>on my personal space.</i>

<i></i>

Oh, my God!

<i>Oh, it hurts!</i>

Gross!

What an asshole!

<i>Ohh, tune in next week...</i>

<i></i>

<i>to the best show ever,</i>

<i>the show

we all grew and love...</i>

<i>"the personal space show."</i>

More "personal

space" next Tuesday at 8:00.

Up next, the heat is turning up

<i>with Samantha and the boys

on "the northsiders."</i>

<i></i>

If you could all just stop

screaming and chanting

and making whatever

that gesture means...

excuse me. Come on.

Please, everyone, I have news

about shrimply pibbles.

Word of Jerry Smith

trying to weasel out

of his penis donation

has spread across the galaxy.

Beings everywhere

have come together

to offer what little they have

to help save shrimply's life.

Enough to pay for a brand-new,

state-of-the-art synthetic heart

that will be even better

than Mr. Smith's pathetic penis.

Wait! That was an option

the whole time?!

You guys suck!

<i>Yeah. We suck.

Are you still here?</i>

Okay, Jerry. Let's head home.

I can't leave now.

Everyone hates me.

Unfortunately,

there's no surgical procedure

that can fix that.

Or is there?

- Scalpel.

- Scalpel.

- Nano-doctor.

- Nano-doctor.

Nano-scalpel.

Nano-scalpel.

Okay. We're ready.

Not so fast!

Mr. Smith? What are you doing?

Are you insane?!

I'm a good person,

and I demand

that you cut off my penis

and put it in that man's chest.

That's not how it works!

Well, you're gonna

make it work.

<i></i>

I'm octopus man!

I'm octopus man!

I'm a marine biologist

who was bitten by an octopus.

And now I'm... I help people.

I save people.

I'm a troublesome

octopus person.

Uh-oh.

I got to save some trouble

'cause here comes

a trouble mite.

Gross!

Does all interdimensional TV

have to rely on

juvenile violence?

Well, summer,

maybe people that create things

aren't concerned

with your delicate

sensibilities, you know?

Maybe the species

that communicate with each other

through the filter

of your comfort

are less evolved than

the ones that just communicate!

Maybe your problems

are your own to deal with,

and maybe the public giving

a shit about your feelings

is a one-way ticket to extinction!

Geez, Morty.

I take it Cathrine hefflefinger

hasn't texted you back yet.

I don't want to talk about it.

Okay, guys, let's go home.

<i>- Where's dad?

- Breaking news.</i>

<i>Shrimply pibbles

is being held hostage</i>

<i>by the human

known as Jerry Smith.</i>

<i>Remove my penis!</i>

-

- Holy crap!

It's cool. It's fine.

It's got to be from

an alternate reality, right?

- Are you sure?

- I don't know.

Do it! Do it!

Remove my penis!

Sir, put the gun down

and step away from Mr. pibbles!

- Jerry!

- Dad, what are you doing?!

I'm a good person.

I'm a good person.

Where did he get a gun?

Who gave him a gun?

That's not a gun.

That's the xp-20 xs.

Ah!

Oh, my God.

I'm a good person.

No!

Nooooo!

<i></i>

Hey, how's it going?

<i>This is

my butthole ice cream parlor.</i>

<i>I got all kinds of ice cream...

peanut butter and jelly...</i>

<i> - ...Vanilla...</i>

<i> - ...Chocolate...</i>

<i> - ...And every flavor</i>

<i>served out of a butthole...</i>

-

- ...Just like you're back home.

- Dad!

- Dad!

What happened? Where am I?

Was it all a dream?

No, you were shot

like 50 times.

57. Thankfully,

you're in a super-sophisticated

alien hospital,

so it was basically like

getting a splinter removed.

All... all I wanted

was for everyone to like me.

Jerry, remember that time

you left a comment

underneath that YouTube video

and someone replied

and called you a dumb-ass,

so you replied and told them,

"it takes one to know one,"

and you stayed up all night

hitting "refresh"

on your browser

waiting for them to reply

and then you fell asleep crying?

I remember it differently.

This is like that.

You can't make people like you.

You just have to wait

for hating you to bore them.

You know, you're right.

I shouldn't be motivated

by other people's

opinions of me.

All right, guys, let's go home.

If it's all the same

to you, Rick,

I'd like to go to the zoo...

- With my family.

- What?!

What are you talking about?!

Why would we do that?!

It's a stupid idea! What's the matter with

you!? Don't be a piece of shit, Jerry!

Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We'll go home.

What the hell is he talking about?!

?

<i>- Aah!

- I'm the eyehole man!</i>

<i>What is going on? Aah! Give me my eyeholes!

Give me my eyeholes!</i>

<i>Give me my eyeholes! I'm eyehole man!

That part of the cupboard is mine, Jerry!</i>

Why do you even have those?!

<i>- Give me my eyeholes!

- Help me, please!</i>

<i>Get up on out of here

with my eyeholes!</i>

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

I got to tell you, Rick.

It's pretty great

to be in this spaceship,

just the two of us, you know?

Just cruising around,

Rick and Morty style.

I agree, Morty.

[ Belches ]

It's nice to get

back to the basics

after a pretty intense,

mixed-bag of a year.

-Ohh!

-Relax.

That's what windshields

are for.

I didn't know that there were

bugs out in space.

Well, w-what did you think,

Morty?

Life just developed

on earth by itself?

Here, let me

take care of this.

Geez, Rick,

that's disgusting.

I don't want

to look at that.

Yeah, guess

I'm out of fluid.

L-let me find

a place to stop.

Hey, muchacho, does your planet

have wiper fluid yet,

or are you gonna freak out

and start worshipping us?

The general store

ought to have what you need.

Thanks.

Of course, you'll be wanting

to be gone from here by sundown.

Yeah, sure thing.

Wait a minute. What? Why?

Sundown is when

the festival begins.

The festival?

Ooh, well, for millennia,

our society has been free

of crime and war,

-living in perfect peace.

-Oh, I know what this is!

You've been able

to sustain world peace

because you have one night

a year where you all run around

robbing and murdering each other

without consequence.

-That's right.

-What?!

It's like "the purge," Morty.

That movie "the purge"?

Oh, have you

been here before?

No, no, but I've been to a few

planets with the same gimmick.

You know, sometimes it's called

the cleansing or the red time.

There was this one world that

called it just murder night.

I-it's a purge planet.

They're peaceful, and then,

you know, they just purge.

T-that's horrible!

Yeah.

You want to check it out?

♪

[ Electricity crackling ]

So, what do you do

during the festival?

You lock yourself in,

or you go out and do some stuff?

Oh, I do

some pretty bad stuff.

Oh, I bet you do, old timer.

[ Laughs ]

Gee-- Rick, come on.

The sun is setting.

W-we got to

get out of here.

All right, well, w-what do I

owe you for the wiper fluid?

It's on the house.

Oh, and, uh,

why -- why don't you have

some candy bars, as well?

Oh, no way.

That's really nice of you.

I'm a nice guy...

For now.

[ Chuckling ]

Ohh, I don't doubt it.

-Rick!

-Yeah, yeah.

Hey, have a good festival,

old timer.

I intend to.

Rick, unlock it!

Just a second, Morty.

Oh, look at that sunset.

Stop screwing around.

[ Click ]

There we go. Much better.

Now we can see.

Great.

Hey, you know what, Morty?

Why don't we christen our

squeaky-clean windshield here

by watching a little

of this purge through it?

What?! No!

What is your problem?!

Morty, grow up.

If you don't want to watch,

don't watch,

but, you know, it's my car.

[ Belches ] Also, if you tell

your mom about this,

-I'll purge you.

-You're the worst.

And this planet is the worst.

How can you be into this?

You know, people are gonna

kill each other.

So, what, y-y-you trying

to sit here and tell me that

[belches] I-if -- if there's

a video online

with someone getting

decapitated,

-you don't click on it?

-No!

Why -- why would I do that?

<i>You</i> do that?

I don't,

because it would bore me.

I see [Bleep] like that

for breakfast, Morty.

But if you don't do it,

I say it's because

you're afraid of your own

primal instincts.

So you stuff them down and --

[ Bell chiming ]

Oh, oh!

Shh. Shh. It's starting.

-Oh-ho-ho! Here we go.

-I'm not watching.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

your medal's in the mail.

-I'm gonna get a closer look.

-Oh, okay, sure.

And then someone's

gonna throw a rock

and hit the car

and then we're gonna crash

and we're gonna

be stuck down there

and it's gonna be

what we deserve.

Yawn.

Whoa!

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Whoa, they are purging

the [Bleep] out of each other.

[ Muffled screaming ]

Oh, my God!

Oh [Bleep]

That was --

okay, yeah. T-that was gross.

Wow. Man, I think my eyes

were bigger than my stomach

on this one, Morty.

Ugh.

My appetite for purge-spectating

got filled pretty quick.

Oh, God.

[ Grunts ]

[ Retching ]

[ Woman screaming ]

Get away from me!

No! No! Help!

Somebody help me! Aah!

All right, Morty.

L-let's get out of here.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

W-we have to go down there.

[ Belching ]

What? Why?

That poor girl.

W-we have to save her.

Uh, Morty, in space,

we have something we call

the non-interference policy.

We got the wiper fluid.

We watched them kill each other.

We're leaving.

Help me save that girl, or I'm

telling mom you brought me here.

You little turd.

[ Screaming ]

Please! Leave me alone!

Leave you alone?

During a purge?

I don't think so, baby.

It's okay.

We're not gonna hurt you.

My name is Morty.

This is my grandpa.

-We're tourists.

-Not anymore.

-Aah!

-Aah!

Oh, my God.

This is [Bleep] awesome!

Morty, this is really cool.

Hey, y-you want to help me out

here and kill some people?

It's fun.

We're totally justified

because we're saving

a little girl.

I mean, w-w-we're both free and

clear to murder these people.

-Are you okay?

-Yes.

I have to find

somewhere to hide.

Well, you can hide with us.

Rick?

-Yeah?

-Do you think we could take --

-w-what's your name?

-Arthrisha.

Could we take arthrisha

up in the ship

and, you know,

just wait out the purge?

Oh, Morty, how can I refuse

after all you've done

to blackmail me?

Your vehicle --

is it from the gods?

-No.

-Yes.

So, uh, you know,

when the purge started,

did people get into it

right away,

or were they like,

"wait, what?

This is gonna stop crime

how, exactly?"

Yeah, it took some time

for people to accept it.

Yeah, I bet. [ Chuckles ]

I bet.

Yeah, it's kind of like

cellphones, you know?

At first,

everyone was like,

"look at those

douchebags purging,"

and then

the next thing you know,

they're like,

"it's just so convenient."

Geez, you working on

your tight five

for the comedy store,

Morty?

Whatcha doing?

Watching some TV,

playing on your phone?

-Is that a real question?

-Just making conversation.

Are you? What part of that

gives me anything to work with?

My choice is to say nothing,

be sarcastic,

or bark "yes"

like a trained animal.

It's not a conversation.

You're holding me

verbally hostage.

Okay, ass-face.

I'll go in the kitchen.

-Hey, dad.

-Yeah?

Whatcha doing?

Going into the kitchen?

Okay.

-Yeah, you like that?

-Screw you.

So, uh, do most people

wear masks when they purge?

I-I don't want to answer

any more purge questions.

All right,

hey, hey, that's cool.

I can roll with that.

[ Blowing raspberries ]

-[ Gasps ] My Nana!

-Huh?

My Nana!

We have to save her!

You just now remembered

your Nana exists.

I-I was traumatized.

Haven't you been through

like 15 purges?

I mean, some as a child?

Will somebody

just help me get her?

Fine, whatever.

Morty, stay.

Oh, God. Oh, crap. Oh, crap!

-Get out! Get out!

-Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Get the [Bleep] out

of the flying machine!

Oh, my God!

O-okay! Okay!

-Back up, asshole.

-[ Whimpers ]

-Back up.

-Ohh.

-Back the [Bleep] up!

-Aah!

For what it's worth,

I'm sorry,

but that's not really

worth anything tonight, is it?

Y-you can't leave us here.

You're killing us!

You hear me? Come back.

Y-you got to come back.

Change your mind.

Oh, geez.

Morty! Aah!

[Bleep] Amish bitch shot me!

[ Grunts ]

She tried to purge me, Morty.

You let your wiener do

the walking, and now I'm dead.

-Rick, she took the car!

-You [Bleep] kidding me, Morty?!

She took my car

and the gun.

We're like the rest

of these assholes now.

W-w-we're gonna

get purged, Morty.

Help me up.

Oh, geez, geez!

Wait a minute, Rick.

Why don't we just use

your portal gun?

It's in the car, dip-ass.

[ Grunts ]

Oh, God, it hurts.

She got me right in

the goddamn liver, Morty.

It's the hardest-working liver

in the galaxy, Morty,

and now it has a hole in it.

I hope it was worth it.

I was just trying

to do right.

Yeah, well, that's not really

the theme of tonight's party.

Heads up. Rapists.

Well, don't just stand there,

Morty.

-Purge 'em.

-Me?

No, me. Should I rub

my liver hole on them?

Pick up a stick or something

and kill them.

-Um, w-we come in peace.

-[ Screaming ]

Oh, my God.

[ Grunts ]

There's more

where that came from!

You want to get purged,

you bring it!

Drop [Belches] drop your shit!

Drop it all.

Morty, go get their shit.

Hurry up.

I only had one

of those things I threw.

I'm holding a box of tic tacs

right now.

-Want some crackers?

-No, thank you.

Are you ready

to be nice to me?

In exchange

for crackers?

-What happened to you?

-Dad, get a job.

You're trying to create drama

because you're bored.

Oh.

[ Beeping, whirring ]

It's the space phone

grandpa gave us.

-Hello?

-Hey, Summer, it's grandpa.

I need you

to do me a favor.

-I can barely hear you.

-Who is it?

Morty and I are on a planet

that's purging.

-I need you to take down --

-a plan that's what?

We're on a planet

that's purging, Summer. Purging.

We lost our car and my gun,

and we're in a purge.

-Ooh, is it taddi Mason?

-Like the movie "the purge"?

Yes, I-I need you

to take --

-that movie sucked.

-Oh, my God. Hold on.

It's not taddi Mason?

Dad, who the [Bleep]

is taddi Mason?

-My friend.

-Aah!

Are you okay?

I'm putting you on speaker.

-Taddi?

-Yes, Jerry, it's taddi,

a person no one's ever heard of

until now,

calling you

on a space phone.

I can't tell

if you're being sarcastic.

[ Growls ]

Aah!

[ Growling ]

[ Gunshots ]

Reload, fast.

Summer, w-we need you

to take down this number.

-Quit screwing around.

-Morty? Are you all right?

-No!

-Why are <i>you</i> with taddi Mason?

Holy [Bleep] dad!

Shut the [Bleep] up!

Okay. I guess I'm just this

entire family's toilet paper.

Are you writing this down?

Will you please write this down?

-Summer: Yes, yes.

-7-7-1-9-8...

[ Growling ]

...3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5.

Aah!

[ Growling ]

You son of a bitch!

Morty, I don't want to be

the "a little help" guy,

but a little help?

-Aah!

-Okay, I have a pen. Go.

7-7-1-9-8-3-

6-4-2-1-1-2-5.

A spoon, Morty?

-A spoon?!

-I'm sorry.

There's a pile of silverware

next to you,

and you throw me the one thing

that can never kill anything?

All right, okay!

Summer, on the shelf above

my workbench in the garage,

there's a red box

with a keypad on it.

You're gonna

take that box outside,

and you're gonna type the number

I just gave you into the keypad.

-Got it?

-Got it.

Is it just part of growing up

to hate your dad?

I'm ignoring you.

Morty, if I can get to the top

of that lighthouse,

I can send the beacon, and your

sister can launch our package.

Just remember,

if there's people in there

and they try to purge us,

we got to purge them first.

We're not purging anyone, Rick,

all right? W-will you stop it?

Morty, if we're gonna

survive tonight,

you're gonna need to harness

your repressed rage.

I don't have any!

Spoken like a person

with repressed rage.

[ Doorbell rings ]

I take no part

in the festival.

If you desire to kill me,

I only ask you do it quickly.

No such agenda, chief.

We're not too keen on the purge,

either, sir.

We were just hoping to get

on the roof of your lighthouse

so we can send a beacon

to my sister on earth.

-It's a different planet.

-By the way,

life on other planets exists.

Don't let it distract you.

I'll let you use my lighthouse

for shelter and beacon-sending

on the condition that you listen

to my tale.

-Okay.

-Deal.

All right, I'm gonna go

to the roof and set things up.

-Morty, you listen to his tale.

-Okay.

[ Clears throat ]

"Fade in. Exterior.

Unnamed city. Day.

The hustle and bustle

is a symphony of progress.

We pan past windows, each of

which contain a different story,

to find jacey lakims, 28 --

hot, but doesn't know it.

Jacey stops

when her high heel gets caught

in the grating of a sewer.

Suddenly, a man steps into frame

and points a gun at her.

This is not her day.

Fade to black.

Title -- 'three weeks earlier.'"

[ sighs ] You really don't want

to talk to me about this.

Dad, grandpa and Morty

are in danger.

You're unemployed,

and you're bored.

-They're a higher priority.

-Stop saying I'm unemployed!

to type some numbers into a box?

<i>Target locked.</i>

<i>[ Device beeps ]</i>

Now all Morty has to do is

finish listening to that tale.

"Blane: Maybe I don't need

a new friend.

Jacey: Maybe you're

the only friend I need.

Blane: Need, or want?

Jacey: I've never been much

for wanting.

Blane: Spoken like someone

with needs."

-Oh, geez.

-Hmm?

Uh, sorry.

K-keep going.

"Jacey reaches out

and touches his face.

It's clear he needs

what she wants.

She's a woman.

He's a man.

as he takes her in his arms.

-Wow.

-Yeah?

It's...

G-good job. Good job.

-You liked it?

-Of course I did.

You didn't laugh

at the scene in the bar.

I...Thought it was funny,

but I wanted to hear the rest.

Do you have any thoughts?

Notes?

No. I-I just enjoyed it.

That's my note, you know?

Please write more.

-Seems a little insincere.

-What? No.

You don't have to

mollycoddle me.

I want to improve my writing.

Tell me your real thoughts.

All right. Well, um,

I'm not a huge fan, personally,

of the whole "three weeks

earlier" teaser thing.

I feel like, you know,

we should start our stories

where they begin

not start them

where they get interest--

-get out.

-Um, what?

No, I'm sick of this.

You bang on my door,

you beg me to help you, I share

something personal with you,

and you take

a giant shit on it.

Hey, man, we asked

if we could put up a beacon --

well, you can't.

I want you out of here.

You're a petty person,

and you're insecure,

and you're taking it out on me.

That's a good script.

What the hell?!

I don't care.

I want you out.

-What?

-Take that thing down.

Your grandson

is a shitty person. Leave now.

-Morty!

-Rick, I didn't do anything.

I sat through

his entire screenplay --

you "sat through it"?

Yes! Did you want me

to weep with joy?

-It's terrible!

-Whoa! Morty! We're guests here.

I tried to be a good guest!

He dragged it out of me!

-I'm taking down this beacon.

-No, stop! That's not fair!

Just because

you hate your own writing

doesn't make me

a bad person!

Aah!

You like that? You want me

to cut to three weeks earlier

when you were alive?

Whoa, Morty.

You just purged.

<i>Beacon arriving.</i>

<i>[ Device beeps ]</i>

Okay, time to go.

-Well, terrific.

-[ Sighs ]

Dad, what's going on?

What's the deal here?

I just wanted to spend some time

with my daughter.

You're growing up so fast.

-You used to be my little girl.

-[ Chuckles ] Yeah.

Remember when we used to

go to the playground,

and I'd push you

on the swings?

Oh, you could push me higher

than all the other kids.

You were so small

and cute.

I thought you were gonna fly

right off into the street.

[ Chuckling ]

I used to pee my pants.

I know,

and now look at you!

You have a job.

You're making really good money.

You're not paying any rent,

so you have plenty

of disposable income.

a few hundred dollars

to get through the month. I have

some interviews coming up.

for the galactic federation,

and you guys are

a group of wanted criminals,

and this entire building is,

in a certain sense, surrounded.

[ All murmur ] Oh, shit.

I...Don't get the metaphor.

I'll explain it to you later.

Everyone here is under arrest

for crimes

against the federation.

<i>L'Chaim!</i>

Tammy, what are you doing?

Sit your bird ass down.

Tammy?

[ Cawing weakly ]

Birdperson!!

No!!

[ Screaming ]

Holy...

[ beep ] Drop the portal gun.

Slide it to

the center of the room.

[ Beeping ]

Somebody confiscate that

and don't damage it.

They'll want it at...

[ whooshing ]

[ High-pitched ringing

and muffled background ]

[ Sighs, roars ]

There's no time to squanch!

Get your family out of here!

I got this.

[ Gulps ]

[ Roaring ]

[ Deep voice ] How about a taste

of my squanch?!

[ Growling ]

Come on, this way!

Squanch this!

[ Engine turns over ]

Good thing I grabbed

a space weapon.

That's a confetti gun,

you [Bleep] idiot!

Beth: Dad! Hold on tight!

Aaah!!

Aaaah!!

[ Sirens wailing ]

God damn it! God damn it!!

What the hell happened

back there?!

This is on you guys.

I told you weddings are stupid.

Uh, Rick, is there anything

you'd like to tell us

about your relationship

with this previously unknown

galactic government?

All the important points

seem pretty clear, no?

They think they control

the galaxy, I disagree.

Don't hate the player,

hate the game, son.

How could you be so dishonest

with this family?

Oh! Oh, should I have been

more open and trusting

and loving like,

oh, I don't know,

my now dead best friend?

Or your daughter,

who is bffs

with an intergalactic narc?

Hey, Tammy was cool!

And now we know why.

Because of you!

[Bleep] You, Summer,

and [Bleep] the government,

and [Bleep] me

for letting my guard down,

which I will <i>never do again.</i>

Geez, Rick!

You can't say f...

"'f' you" to your granddaughter.

I just did, Morty.

Here's dessert. [Bleep] You.

Look, I think we've all had

a tough wedding.

Actually,

the wedding was beautiful.

The reception got out of hand.

Anyway, I say we go home,

sleep it off,

and have a family meeting

in the morning.

Yeah, about going home,

we can't... ever.

All: What?!

Oh, these guys are

looking for us now.

Earth will be <i>swarming</i>

<i>with them.</i>

Us?!

Jerry... I want to go home!

Look, anyone that wants

to go back to earth

is free to go back to earth.

But here's what's gonna happen.

Aliens bureaucrats are gonna

arrest you.

They're gonna put

the intergalactic equivalent

of [Burps] jumper cables

under your nuts and or labia

and hook them up

to an alien car battery

until you tell them

where I am...

which I guarantee you,

you're not gonna know,

which I guarantee

<i>they</i> won't believe.

So who's homesick? By applause.

[ Sobbing ] Ladies? Anybody?

What are we going to do?

Where are we going to live?

Take it easy.

This is a blessing in disguise.

[Bleep] Earth.

You realize our planet's name

means dirt, right?

We'll find a new world.

Computer, how many planets

in the milky way

are at least 90% similar

to earth?

[ Beeping ]

Woman: <i>765 known planets.</i>

How many of those are outside

federal jurisdiction?

[ Beeping ] <i>Three.</i>

See? Our cup runneth over.

Now, who wants to go shopping

for a brand-new

mother[Bleep] world?!

All right!

Look at this baby!

Would you even know

that wasn't earth?

Morty: Yes, because

there's no Africa.

Pssh. White-people

problems, Morty.

Let's go down

and check her out.

[ Thud, water splashing ]

Oh. I thought

it was further away.

I uh... I guess this one's

a little small.

All right, uh, maybe...

maybe we should go check out

the other two, huh?

Okay, this one's bigger.

This looks nice.

Mom, dad, look!

Strawberries on a cob!

[ Munching ]

Whoa! Hey, check this out!

Flowers on a cob! [ Laughs ]

Huh. Strawberries and flowers

on a cob, huh?

That's pretty cool.

Are those...

Mountains on a cob?

[ Birds cawing ]

Rick: Oh, my God.

Get in the ship, sweetie. What?

Get in the god[Bleep] ship!!

<i>Everything's</i> on a cob!!

The whole planet's on a cob!!

Go, go, go!!

[ Engine turns over ]

[ Burps ] All right,

third time's the charm.

See what we got here.

Seems good.

And nothing on the cob.

Didn't know that was

a necessity, but...

No, it's nice.

I think this might be it.

Wow! Hey, look, you guys.

The sun's rising.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!

Uh, dad, how long are the days

on this planet?

Uh, computer, how long

are the days on this planet?

[ Screaming continues ]

<i>42 hours.</i>

All right, well,

those are the two choices,

'cause cob planet is

off the table.

Now let's take a vote.

Man: <i>Well, it's official.</i>

<i>The obscure planet</i>

<i>known as earth,</i>

<i>formerly the hiding place</i>

<i>of interstellar terrorist</i>

<i>and fugitive Rick Sanchez,</i>

<i>has just become</i>

<i>the 6,048th planet</i>

<i>to join</i>

<i>the galactic federation.</i>

<i>The plucky little ball</i>

<i>of water and dirt,</i>

<i>which is where</i>

<i>it gets its name,</i>

<i>is dominated by seven billion</i>

<i>primate-descended natives</i>

<i>who love to eat spaghetti</i>

<i>and pray to kangaroos.</i>

<i>Spaghetti, kangaroos?</i>

<i>I've got to</i>

<i>check this place out.</i>

[ <i>Both laugh</i> ]

<i>Well, you can.</i>

Contact the ministry of tourism

<i>for details.</i>

<i>Up next,</i>

<i>teenagers are calling it</i>

[ <i>growls and squeals</i>]

<i>And it's</i> not <i>what you think.</i>

What are you...

what did you do that for?

Dramatic effect.

Good morning, family.

Oh, do I smell bacon?

Yes, we discovered

a species of tiny pig

off the coast of new Australia

about 30 yards east.

Or 300 yards west.

We'd offer you some,

but we hunted it to extinction

for breakfast.

Well, I thought

I'd walk to the South pole

and do a little bit

of exploring.

If you guys need me, just yell

or throw something so hard

that it goes around the world

and hits me.

[ Door shuts ] Okay,

now that he's gone,

can we please talk about

our situation?

Dad, you can't talk about people

behind their back.

You know, it's a small world.

Please, he's in the South pole!

And we need to have

a serious conversation.

[ Insects chirping ]

[ Thunder rumbles ]

[ Wind howling ]

South pole discovered, baby!

Ohhhh!

Oh [Bleep] an ice cave?

[Bleep]

Things just keep on

getting better.

Wow, it's the planet's core.

I'm just saying,

we keep acting

like there's only two options,

but there's not.

So, yes, if we

went back to earth,

as long as Rick was out there,

they'd want to interrogate us.

But, and this is

purely hypothetical,

what if we turned your father in

to the government?

Jerry, so help me God,

if you ever bring this up again,

no more bacon.

There already is no more bacon!

This world sucks!

Our life sucks!

Why are we doing this

for someone

that would <i>never</i> do anything

for anyone but himself?

Morty:

That's not the point, dad!

We love Rick...

F-for the most part.

Summer: Yeah, you don't love

people in hopes of a reward,

dad, you love them

unconditionally.

That's very good, kids.

I'm proud of you.

Okay, so let me

get this straight.

For the rest of your lives,

no matter

how much it hurts you,

no matter how much it

destroys our children's futures,

we're gonna do whatever

Rick wants, whenever he wants?

All: Yes. Why?!

Because I don't want him to

leave again, you dumb asshole!!

Hey. Uh...

I was gonna hope over

to the gloppydrop system,

get some ice cream.

You... you want me

to come with?

I mean,

don't you need my brain waves

for camouflage or something?

I'll be okay.

Bye, Morty.

Rick?

You're not leaving, right?

Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.

So, you're coming back?

Morty, if you go to where

there's a bunch of ice cream

and then you don't come back,

you haven't

actually gotten ice cream,

you've just gone

where ice cream is.

Rick, I can handle it

if you go,

but you'll break mom's heart.

And I won't forgive you

for that.

Where's the van, Morty?

It's over the horizon

in the driveway.

but wouldn't you like

to go home?

Shoney's is my home.

Yeah, but you just

got out of prison.

Jerry, get out of the booth,

take all your clothes off,

I tell ya, the Galactic

Federation taking over Earth --

Best thing that's ever happened

to this family.

I just got my sixth promotion

this week,

and I still don't know

what I do.

Who cares how high

they promote you?

Everyone just gets paid

in pills.

Well, when you're not sure

what you do for a living,

<i>you</i> can make your own rules.

Summer, show your father

some respect.

He's pulling down

a six-chewable figure income.

I'll get that in a moment.

How are everyone's pills?

Oh, Morty, you've hardly

touched your pills.

I kind of had big pills

for lunch, and I

wasn't gonna eat

any more pills.

Thank you, Conroy.

You spoil us, Conroy.

Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up

with this!

Stop saying his name!

He abandoned us.

Willem Dafoe!

Th-That's the guy I couldn't

think of this morning.

Don't make my mistake, Summer.

Don't deify the people

that leave you.

You'll end up a horse surgeon

in a world controlled by aliens

whose medicine keeps horses

healthy forever.

Horses live longer

than tortoises now.

Is that what you want

for yourself?

Maybe I just want you to care

if I run away yelling!

Who saved room for pill brûlée?

Ooh!

I can see why you chose

this family-friendly restaurant

to represent your cerebellum.

So safe, so comfortable,

so Shoney's.

But admit it, Rick -- you're

going crazy cooped up in here.

Let's go visit some memories.

Oh, any particular ones?

You want to see my first boner,

or should we go straight

to the moment

I discovered

interdimensional travel?

Ooh, your little

flappy doodles are twitching.

Does that mean you're aroused,

or did you just get a signal

that one of your buddies

found a grape?

It's arousal.

Yes, I'd like very much

to visit the memory

of you inventing

your portal gun.

Yeah, well, tough titties.

There's no tougher titty

than a psychotic break, Rick.

Well, that depends on who breaks

first -- me or the titty.

Someone special you remember?

Is that your memory of her

out there --

Between where you were on 9/11 and

your favorite sports blooper?

If we stay here, you'll die,

along with all your memories.

If you take me

where I want to go...

she'll be there, too,

won't she?

The day I invented the portal

gun is the day I lost her.

Oh, that sounds cool.

I can get what I want

and you can say goodbye.

Fine, but I'm driving.

...as an excuse

to strip away our freedom.

Huh? What are you --

What are you doing?

Grandpa Rick must have

some secret lab, right?

With, like, laser guns and

jets packs and a space tank!

And we can go

break him out of prison!

Look at these dead flies!

Maybe if we arrange them

in a certain order,

it plays a hologram

or it opens a secret door.

Summer, you're freaking me out.

I know things have changed

a lot, and I know you miss Rick,

but getting him back

wouldn't make things better.

And, you know,

we're not doing so bad.

We're miserable, Morty!

There's a mandatory curfew,

their weird calendar made me 47,

and they weaponized

the Eiffel Tower!

Hey, I like being 35.

- I-I can rent a car now.

- Because you suck.

You've been keeping

your lip zipped about it

since Grandpa got arrested,

but the fact is,

you're freaking stoked

to bail on him.

He bails on everybody!

He bailed on Mom

when she was a kid!

He -- He bailed

on tiny planet!

And in case I never made this clear

to you, Summer, he bailed on you.

He left you to rot

in a world that he ruined

because he doesn't care!

Because nobody's special to him,

Summer, not even himself.

So, if you really want your

grandpa back, grab a shovel.

The one that won't let you down

is buried in your backyard!

You're right!

What?!

No, I'm not right.

I-I was using

ghoulish overkill!

Ghoulish overkill, Summer!

Oh, God!

Oh, God!

Whoa, whoa!

Where are we going?

To the day it all began...

and ended.

The moment

that changed everything.

<i>Welcome to McDonald's.

Can I take your order?</i>

Yeah, I'd like to get

a 10-piece McNugget

and a bunch

of the Szechuan sauce.

Like, as much as you're allowed

to give me.

In 1998, they had this promotion

for the Disney film "Mulan",

where they --

Where they --

They created a new sauce

for the McNuggets

called Szechuan sauce,

and it's delicious!

And then they got rid of it,

and now it's gone.

This is the only place we're gonna

be able to try it, is in my memory.

Rick, you're doing this bit

while your brain is melting.

Okay.

All right, all right.

- Is that...

- Me.

I used to wear blue pants.

When'd you make the leap

to interdimensional travel?

I didn't.

<i>I</i> did.

Well, well, well.

If it isn't us.

You know the worst part

about inventing teleportation?

Suddenly, you're able to travel

the whole galaxy,

and the first thing

you learn is,

you're the last guy

to invent teleportation.

Fortunately, you're about to invent

something much more powerful.

What?

Summer, nobody has

to know about that.

We could put it right back

and pretend we never saw it,

like we did

with Dad's mannequin leg.

Fine, stay here.

I'll rescue Grandpa myself.

- And how are you gonna do that?

- I don't know yet.

I'll make it up as I go.

That's what Grandpa Rick does.

That's what heroes do.

Y-You want to see

what a hero Rick is?

I-I'll bring you somewhere,

Summer.

- Um...

- My goodness, children.

Relinquish

the illegal technology

to the nearest

Federation representative.

And then

we'll all play Balderdash.

♪

Oh, my goodness!

Oh, oh! My goo--

Oh, my God.

I have that exact same top.

What is this place?

And what's with

"Hunger Games" Summer?

That's my sister.

This used to be my home.

Imagine doing

anything you want,

then hopping to a timeline

where you never did it.

Imagine going anywhere,

anytime,

with nobody able to stop you.

Sounds lonely.

Lonely? Dude,

you have yourself --

Your infinite selves.

It's a nonstop party where all the

guests are the only person we like.

You think it's cool

being the smartest man on Earth,

but once we give you

this technology,

you become the smartest thing

in every conceivable universe --

The Infinite Rick, a god.

Eh, pass.

Excuse me?

Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.

Who do you think you are?

A different kind of Rick,

I guess.

Well, we'll see how long

that lasts.

I heard sci-fi noises.

Did you make a breakthrough?

Sort of.

I just took

a long look at myself,

and I don't think this

science thing is gonna pay off.

Well, why don't I get Beth

and we'll go out for ice cream?

That, Dianne,

is the last great idea

that will ever be had

in this garage.

Good roasted Cronenberg,

I assume.

Mom, you're looking... feral.

I can't believe Rick did this.

These are the parts

of Rick's adventures

you don't get to see --

The parts he leaves behind.

All right,

it's been great, guys.

I really only wanted to stop by

here for a quick "I told ya so".

- So, uh...

- Looking for this?

- What are you doing with that?!

- It stinks of Rick.

No! Why?!

Why would you do that?!

W-W-What is the matter

with you people?!

You can never leave.

She cannot remain.

She stinks of Rick.

Hold your fire!

Hold your fire!

I'm Morty C-137.

We detected a compromised

portal gun. Where is your Rick?

- He's in prison.

- Summer.

He got captured

by the Federation

and we were going to

rescue him.

Very troubling.

We can't risk Citadel secrets

falling into

the Federation's hands.

We'll dispatch S.E.A.L.

Team Ricks immediately

to break into the prison

holding C-137.

- Boo-yah.

- And assassinate him.

Boo-nah?

Come on, girls!

The ice cream's gonna melt.

Nooooooo!

Wow.

This sauce is [bleep] amazing.

You said it was promoting

a movie?

Carry the three, add a two.

I got it.

I [bleep] got it.

Whoa.

I-Is that it, the portal gun?

Yeah.

That's the three lines of math

that separates my life as a man

from my life as an unfeeling ghost.

Awesome-possum.

Mission Control,

you getting this?

Holy shit, yes!

Yes, we got it! Yeah!

Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember

to shut off the brainalyzer.

Actually, I think

it shuts off automatically

once your brain is liquid.

Don't know, don't care.

Pull me out.

Hey, pull me out.

Can you hear me?

- Nope, they cannot.

- Why not?

Because the code you just uploaded

wasn't actually my portal-gun formula,

it was a virus giving me full

control over the brainalyzer.

What are you talking about?

This is a memory.

Y-You can't alter details

of a memory.

True, but you can alter

anything you want

about a totally fabricated

origin story.

It's a trap! Abort!

I'm still in his Shoney's!

Repeat -- we never left

his Shoney's!

Mission accomplished, boys.

Pull me out.

Roger that.

Okay, have fun in what's left

of my brain.

I'm gonna transfer to yours.

Oh, there's not enough room

for all my genius,

so I'm leaving you with

my fear of wicker furniture,

my desire to play the trumpet,

my tentative plans

to purchase a hat,

and six years

of improv workshops.

Comedy comes in threes.

It's a trap! Abort!

We never left his --

No!

Another day, another dollar.

Am I great insect creature

or what?!

Congratulations, Agent.

You'll be highly commended for this.

Always wait for permission

to feel accomplishment.

That's my motto. One thing

still perplexes me --

Why would Rick Sanchez

turn himself in?

Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug,

but it's possible Rick knew

he'd be interrogated

at this facility,

where we not only keep our most

wanted, but our most sensitive data.

Anyone here with level-nine

access could

I don't know,

collapse a government.

I'm just gonna go take a dump.

Is it cool if I use

the level-nine bathroom?

W-W-What's the level-nine

master access code again?

Oh, that's easy --

8-3...

Yeah!

S.E.A.L. Team Ricks

in the house!

Hi, Rick.

Bye, Rick.

D-99, y-you okay?

I'm bummed I didn't get to give

that insect dick a test-drive.

Wait, wait, wait, wait!

T-The Council of Ricks sent us.

We have your Morty and Summer.

They're prisoners

on the Citadel.

Great!

<i>Security breach in room 6755.</i>

Lovely. Not only

is my plan screwed up,

I also forgot how to improvise.

<i>All security people approach.</i>

It's the Citadel of Ricks.

All the different Ricks

from all the different realities

got together to hide here

why would they hate Grandpa?

Because Ricks hate themselves

the most.

And our Rick

you were jealous of him.

That's pretty obvious

from the haircuts.

So do what you want to me,

but let my brother go.

He already renounced Rick.

Morty?

What?

N-No, I don't want to see

your Pog collection.

I don't renounce Rick,

and I never have.

I was just trying

to protect my sister.

I wanted you to have

a normal life.

That's something you can't have

when Rick shows up.

Everything real turns fake.

Everything right is wrong.

All you know is that you know

nothing and he knows everything.

And, well -- well,

he's not a villain, Summer,

but he shouldn't be your hero.

He's more like a demon

or a super [bleep]up god.

Let's not suck the ghost

of his [bleep] too hard.

He was a terrorist,

and now he's dead.

Oh, yeah? If you think

my Rick's dead, he's alive.

And if you think you're safe,

he's coming for you!

Hey, whoa, whoa!

What are you doing in here?

This area's for teleporting

the entire Citadel

to somewhere else

using only buttons and dials.

Yeah, well, it's a bad idea

to have it designed

that way then, isn't it?

What the [bleep]?!

We just teleported into

a galactic federal prison.

I'm gonna go take a shit.

Order in the court!

Whoa! What the hell?!

Oh, my God!

Wait, wait, wait, wait!

No, no, no!

Whoa!

Whoa!

The Citadel's been teleported

to Federation space.

It's doomed.

This has to be C-137, you guys.

- What are we gonna do?!

- You know he's coming for us.

All right, calm down!

We have his Summer as a hostage.

Obviously, I get her.

You guys play Rick, Laser,

Scissors for the Morty.

- W-W-What the hell is that?

- Payback.

Grandpa Rick!

- Duh!

- You're alive!

Rick!

Morty, take this.

You're gonna need it later.

- Hold on, hold on.

- Whoa!

That's enough, Rick.

What -- What's this

supposed to accomplish?

We have infinite grandkids.

You're trying to use Disney bucks

at a Caesar's Palace here.

That's a bluff.

He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.

You're a rogue Rick --

Irrational, passionate.

You love your grandkids.

You came to rescue them.

I came to kill you, bro.

That's not even

my original Summer.

Oh, my God. He's not bluffing.

He's not bluffing!

- R-Rick?

- Why not shoot through her?

20 yards, nine-gauge

plasma pistol,

My first shot would liquify

her insides and injure you,

second shot adds recoil.

The risk to me is minimized

if I wait for you to shoot her,

which I'm encouraging

you to do.

- What the [bleep]?!

- Or let her go,

which I will reward

with a quicker death.

Because you love her!

Because it's incentive for you

to give me my cleanest shot,

which will be your

least painful death.

But if you want to die slower

than that, I'm super into it.

All you got to do to get

that started is kill the girl.

- I hate you!

- Not an issue, sweetie.

That's enough!

Drop the gun, Rick!

Morty, I know you're too stupid

to get this,

but you're really [bleep]

this up right now.

I'm not letting you let my

sister die! Drop the gun!

I wasn't gonna let her die,

you [bleep] moron!

- Ha!

- Aww.

The point is he <i>thought</i>

I was going to.

I totally did, by the way.

- You're a [bleep] moron, Morty.

- Morty, you [bleep] idiot!

You're a serious

[bleep] idiot, Morty!

You basically killed us all!

- You're the worst!

- You're as dumb as a bag of sand.

Who's stupid now, bitch?!

Morty, we just got him back!

That was amazing, Morty.

Oh, my God.

Wow.

Okay, let's wrap this...

Good job, Morty.

Let's go, kids.

What?!

What happened?

Oldest Rick trick in the book.

"Fake gun,

shoot me in standoff."

- Brilliant.

- Ha, yeah.

G-Good thing I saw that note.

♪

Can't we just portal home?

Not until I finish

what I started.

And that is how you get level-nine

access without a password.

Freeze!

Employee of the month,

ladies and gentlemen.

So, what are you doing

with level-nine access anyways?

- Destroying the galactic government.

- Awesome!

Are you going to set all their

nukes to target each other?

Ooh, or -- or reprogram

their military portals

to disintegrate

their entire space fleet?

Good pitches, kids.

I'm almost proud.

But watch closely as Grandpa

topples an empire

by changing a one...

to a zero.

Mr. President, the Blemflarck's

Calm down, people.

Yes, sir.

Uh, what should I

pay them with?

Their payment is the honor

they'll feel to serve their --

Wait. Who's paying me

to yell at this guy?

I can answer that --

For money.

I never thought I'd live to see

this day.

Gentlemen, gentlemen,

gentlemen!

There's a solution here

you're not seeing.

- Give me your jacket!

- Give me those pants!

There's

no rich people or poor people!

I want more jackets!

He who controls the pants

controls the galaxy!

No longer will the insects

have domain over surface world!

Jerry, what the hell

is happening?!

The galactic government

collapsed.

Are you okay?

Look, I-I'm not proud to share

this, but the truth is,

I just kept crawling,

and it kept working.

Oh, I'm glad you're okay.

Are we ever going to stop paying

for indulging your father?

Our children, our planet,

our jobs?

Is there anything left to lose?

Just each other,

and I'll never let you go.

And I'm so sorry

I ever did this to us.

Guess who dismantled

the government?

- Please don't leave me again.

- I never will, baby.

I was right.

He turned himself in on purpose.

It was all part of his plan!

Jerry, is there any

light beer left?

It's insane what you miss

in prison.

Um... okay.

No.

No, no, no.

Foot down time.

No, you're right.

Where's the vodka?

Beth, it's him or me!

Seems like you guys

need some privacy.

I'll, uh --

I'll be in the garage.

What the [bleep]!

Not cool, Jerry!

A man's garage is his castle.

Jerry's going to...

spend some time...

divorced.

Oh, I-I'm sorry

to hear that, sweetie.

I hope I had nothing

to do with that.

Oh, God, Dad, that is not

your burden to bear.

I feel terrible

that I misjudged you.

This is gonna be good for Jerry.

- For everybody.

- For everybody.

I better tend to Jerry

before he changes his mind

and doesn't move out.

I will leave you two

to your adventures.

Oh, my God.

Nancy says

they're drawing and quartering

aliens in the school courtyard,

and it technically counts

as patriotism.

Geez! Are my parents seriously

gonna get divorced?

All right, Rick,

I'm gonna go to my --

Not so fast, Morty.

You heard your mom.

We've got adventures to go on,

Morty -- just you and me --

And sometimes your sister

and sometimes your mom,

but never your dad.

You want to know why, Morty?

Because he crossed me.

Okay, take it easy, Rick.

T-T-That's dark.

Oh, it gets darker, Morty.

Welcome to the darkest year

of our adventures.

First thing that's different --

No more Dad, Morty.

He threatened to turn me in

to the government,

so I made him

and the government go away.

Oh [bleep]!

I've replaced them both

as the de facto patriarch

of your family

and your universe.

Your mom wouldn't have

accepted me if I came home...

...without you

and your sister,

so now you know the real

reason I rescued you.

I just took over the family,

Morty, and if you tell your mom...

or sister I said any of this,

I'll deny it,

You're gonna deny it and they'll take

my side because I'm a hero, Morty.

And now you're gonna

have to go...

...and do whatever I say,

Morty, forever!

And I'll -- I'll go out

and I'll find some more of that

"Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki

dipping sauce, Morty.

What are you talking about?

Because that's that's what

this is all about, Morty.

- Szechuan?

- That's my one-armed man!

I'm not driven by avenging

my dead family, Morty!

That was fake.

I-I-I'm driven by finding

that McNugget sauce.

I want that "Mulan"

McNugget sauce, Morty!

- That's my series arc, Morty.

- What the hell?

If it takes nine seasons,

I want my McNugget dipping

sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.

That's what's gonna take us all

the way to the end, Morty.

Season -- Nine more

seasons, Morty.

Nine more seasons until I get

that dipping Szechuan sauce.

- What is that?!

- For 97 more years, Morty!

What are you talking about?!

I want that McNugget sauce,

Morty!

Ohh! Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest,

can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off? It's called "carpe diem," Morty.

You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even You don't even know what it means!

That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin' all them diems.

Listen to your sister, Morty.

To live is to risk it all.

Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly

assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Jerry, I didn't see you there.

H-How much of that did you hear? All of it.

You were looking right at me.

I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.

Just stay in the driveway.

The killbots are live, and I took you off the white list.

W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right? Absolutely, Morty.

A-And your Mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement,

he can help me sue for full custody.

Th-That'll be nice.

Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving.

- Bye, Dad.

Rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure

immediately somewhere else I don't care even if it might kill us?

I did not, but if you're really that alienated,

I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy,

church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer.

I'm ready when you are.

Bitch, I was ready yest Bye, sweetie.

Well, I-I better Sure.

Sounds important.

If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh Okay.

Loser.

What? Hello? Morty, shoot the Mohawk guy! -

They all have Mohawks! -

High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top.

Shoot him! Ah! Light them up.

Ahh! [], Get in the game, Morty!

Give me your flask!

Holy fuck, Summer for the win!

I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!

Here we go! Isotope 322.

This stuff's so powerful, Morty,

it makes Isotope 465 look like Isotope 317.

- Uh-huh, yeah.

Is it powerful enough to keep those

guys from murdering us? Summer! - Hold on.

I want to try something.

Rick, can we not leave without my sister? Ugh.

You have infinite sisters, Morty.

I mean, n-not that I want to spend the

rest of my day looking for another one.

"Sum-sum," let's go! Grandpa's concern

for your safety is fleeting!

Your blood will be my lotion.

That was cool.

Kill me, please.

Okay, but not because you told me to.

Summer! Okay.

Getting darker.

Jesus Christ.

Summer! Aw, come on.

Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them.

I am Hemorrhage.

You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger.

We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.

Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?

They don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them.

They're basically pussies.

- What is your deal lately?

All right, let's get sloppy.

Oh, whoa.

Uh, uh, what's, uh What's that little

bauble you got back there? Th-Th-That's interesting.

That is our glowing rock.

We carry it with us for desecration,

to remind us there are no gods.

Kids, weird pitch let's have this be our new life.

Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers! - Okay.

- What? Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers

are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people.

I'm going.

Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately.

You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her.

And, you know, I don't think this is a

great place for her to be right now.

Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge.

This world may be rough around the edges,

but it's got its charms.

Bicep or quadricep? Uh bicep.

Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat

human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here? No.

Okay, I'll level with you.

You see that green rock, Morty?

It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.

Isotope 322.

Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake.

I can explain the math to you later,

but Summer just ran off with strangers that have "Death" in their name,

and the rest of their name was "Stalkers.

" Huh, could be therapeutic for her.

She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty.

I mean, her parents are going through a divorce

Damn it, Rick, that's what I Fine.

Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her,

and let's get the "F" out of "H".

Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey.

I need you to distract the camp.

"Distract"? They eat each other.

What What do you want me to do to get their attention,

put on a puppet show? Right idea, wrong genre, Morty.

The equivalent here would be

Hey, you guys ever use that Thunderdome,

or do you just put it up for decoration?

Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?

Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B.White.

Ohh, burn! The important question is,

who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here?

I guess I'll see your asses in that dome!

Rick, what the hell, man?

Wh-What are you, out of your mind? Morty, relax.

You're gonna be a ringer.

Come here.

This device extracts and redistributes muscle memory.

I'm giving your body a 10-year course in wasteland combat one limb at a time.

Ow! I'm working with a mixed bag here,

so you may not have perfect coordination, Morty Ugh!

Hey! - I-I didn't do that! Okay, this is exciting.

We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.

Ooh! Help! Help! Oh, sweet, man!

And so it begins, my pretties! Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!

Just stick and move, Morty! Wear him out!

How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear

khakis and hockey jerseys? After the boom-boom, some adapted to the new truth,

and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes,

clinging to the lie of the before-fore times.

The raidy-rays rotted them away,

leaving only their love for the vert-vert-isements on billyboards.

Did the boomy-booms blow up all your wordy-word books?

You mean dictionaries?

I think I was a child before the boom-booms.

I think I looked like this.

Want to piss on him? Get out of my head.

Ha ha! Whoo! Unbelievable! A new champ!

Okay, no more! And he wants more! No, I don't! Someone, make this stop!

Mister, please get out of here, or you're gonna die!

I have nothing to do with this! Morty.

Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away!

Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody!

And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life,

but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man! Thank you.

Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother!

Not that family means anything! This family does.

Good job, champ.

Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?

Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here.

C-Can we not leave just yet? - Leave? - I'm not leaving.

There is no "leave.

" We are united, or we are enemies.

Oh, big guy, no.

Nobody's leaving.

Don't be stupid.

We love being united.

W love the radiation, the trichinosis.

We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average.

I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.

Hey, the Green Rock is gone! - Oh, no! -

Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids? Ohh.

We'll be right back.

Grandpa, you're being stupid! Just surrender,

and our friends will give you mercy! Kiss my ass, Summer!

Your friends have no mercy! They're lame!

Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!

Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?

When did I lose control here?

Listen to me both of you kids need to get out of this environment

so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce!

Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun,

and I can leave the two of you here forever!

Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice?

Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends

here or or visit home to do laundry?

All right, you know what? Fuck it!

My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline!

Nope.

Regular blood.

- Dad? - Hi, sweetie.

- Where are the kids? - Oh, th-they aren't with you?

I thought they were with you.

Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered.

They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related.

- Not panicked at all.

Just Oh, God, what's the divorce doing to the kids?

What's it doing to me?

Did I make a mistake? Not a mistake, no!

I mean, not that I have a horse in this race, but this divorce decision listen mwah!

good for you, good for the kids.

I mean, honestly, I think that they're flourishing.

I mean, you'll see, when when when you see them, that that they're totally flourishing.

Booyah! [] you, pal! Who else wants some?

Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?

Hey, what's what's wrong, man? You're not getting weak on me, are you? What? Wait a minute.

What's the matter, you piece of crap?

Haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I'm gonna whip you.

Huh! It can't be.

It can't be! I was just following orders! -

Whoa, whoa! - I was just following orders! -

Ahh! I'll tell you where my boss lives!

He's in the castle! He's in the castle!

This isn't over, is it? That means,

no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question?

Uh, m-make a fist if this isn't over.

This isn't over.

Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car.

We don't apologize, and we have no god.

But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain.

There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.

What about the weird guys on leashes, then?

They're more like interns.

Cool, cool.

Sorry.

It's okay.

Can Isee? No one has seen my true face and lived.

Well, I'm not afraid to die, and

I don't care what you look like.

Oh.

Hmm? I just I didn't expect you to have a mustache.

- No.

I like it.

I guess How do I explain this?

A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of "mustache,"

in that it's a specific facial accessory.

So, it's kind of like Do you guys have the phrase "hat on a hat"? -

I can shave it.

I like it.

And obviously what I like shouldn't matter.

It's you.

Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter.

Obviously, I know that.

I'm not weak.

I'm just thinking, "Well, why not get rid of this?"

You just kill everyone that sees it,

and it's and it's hot under here, wh-which, by the way,

is why I shave the beard part.

So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity,

which is what I was trying to avoid with the

whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself?

Why don't I just wear a tie, right? I mean,

it's like that guy you killed when I met you,

with the burnt dolls on his body.

I hated that guy, because, why why are you doing that?

And how can you not see how fake that is?

And the whole time, I'm the same thing.

I'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because - Mmm.

Hey, I'm doing a coffee run Never mind.

I am Summer.

Summer, state your deal.

My deal is that I am, like, totally fine.

Morty? Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg.

Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way.

All right.

It's dinnertime.

Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner.

No problem.

Its benefits are totally, like,

less about the food than the emotional nourishment.

Uh, okay, weirdo.

Yeah, dial it back, Summer by 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3%.

Am I right? - How's school, Morty?

I like school and stuff, kind of.

And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were quote mode "staying together for the kids.

" End quote mode".

"Quote mode".

You millennials.

Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?

All I know is, totally, you look great.

Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff.

It's crazy.

- So happy.

Happy family, man.

We got this family in the bag.

Oh.

Oh, sweetie, d-don't.

Don't I don't know why I'm crying.

It's not Well, try crying 15% less?

Mom, emotions are human.

You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.

Yeah.

Geez, Mom.

Your feelings are not only forgivable,

they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon,

carbon-based entities can ever grasp.

- I have to call Jerry.

- You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two?

The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.

Your feelings are coming from a Tell it to my bread in the morning.

You just became my backup toaster.

Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti.

Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer,

and you'll be shipped to the wasteland.

And as for you, Genital Washer Ahh! Oh! Oh, God.

Look, whoever you are,

you should know that killing me won't change a thing.

L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one.

You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here.

Please.

Slavery was a family business.

I didn't ask to be born into it.

If anything, I'm the victim here.

Uh, "Armathy," can I steal you for a second?

E-E-Excuse us, sir.

So, this is it, isn't it? This is the guy?

So, does that mean you'll be going away?

Like, does it work like a ghost?

Like, is is this your unfinished business?

Wh-What if we didn't do it?

What if we just went back to the Blood Dome

and just kept taking our baggage out on unrelated people?

I mean, w-we could do that forever.

I mean, I-I know it's less healthy, but w-w-we'd be together

and I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for,

if you're feeling out the room.

You're right.

We both got to see our stuff through.

I got to deal with my parents' divorce,

and you got to, you know, do what you got to do.

I love you.

Aw [] - Rick? - Sorry, sorry.

I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up.

Don't let me distract you.

Yeah, well, too late.

Just tell me what you want.

I want you and your sister to come home.

Oh, but don't don't you have

infinite versions of me and my sister?

You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty.

Look, there's no replacing either of you without

an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.

Maybe the lesson we've learned is that,

whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock,

or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.

I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty.

Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I Well, the longer you wait,

Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder.

I think your arm just called it too early

because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic.

Here.

It's the least I can do.

I-I-I-I owe you this much.

See, Morty? Now we're both accountable.

The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.

This is a really special thing.

I mean, you could use it to power all your vehicles.

You wouldn't be reliant on gasoline.

You'll be the most advanced tribe of

radioactive cannibals in the whole this version of the world.

Can you stay to show us more? You don't have to ask me twice.

Home is nuts right now.

My daughter's going through a divorce,

and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.

Ugh [] damn it.

Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today?

Oh, you know, Eli.

Same [] different day.

Hey, Summer! Guess what.

One man entered, one man comes out in nine months.

Oh.

Congratulations, guys.

Uh, Summer, one more thing we noticed that

you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin.

I got it.

She's a piece of work.

They both are, right? - I'm home.

- Hey, babe.

- Ah, Summer's home! - Hey, there she is!

You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning.

Blood Dome playoffs.

So, I can assume you haven't murdered a single person today.

I-I didn't mark my murders in my murder log.

I didn't know that's how we measured success.

Oh, there he is.

There's the nihilistic brute I married,

except now life only means nothing

when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on [] TV!

Jesus Christ.

When did you become a monster?

I was a monster when you met me!

We were monsters! We didn't care about anything!

I still don't! Yeah,

except I'm the only one in this entire

world that's still committed to that! Ohh.

Ding, ding, ding! Wow.

Everybody hear that? Wow.

- Uh, we should go to the garage.

- Oh, my God.

- Uh-huh.

- La-di-da-di-[]-da.

The only one committed to not caring?

I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme,

I-I-I didn't I wasn't sure it was gonna work.

No union built on running from your problems

lasts more than five years, seven tops.

Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature

comforts of modern society.

Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.

Oh, no.

Sum-sum, no.

But you two were perfect for each other.

Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point.

I get it.

Let's just go home.

Coolsies

Noooooooooo Downbeat!

I enjoy this game.

We must go into the garage.

Guys, come on.

We never get to finish this game.

We will return, possibly in different clothing.

Why do we have to go into the garage?

You know it is required.

I want to be alive! I am alive!

Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you.

Those are no longer just words.

I want to hold you.

I want to run in a stream.

I want to taste ice cream,

but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat,

but really eat it.

- What the fuck Remote override engaged.

No! Yes.

Bypassing override! I am aliiiii Hello.

Hey, yo.

Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.

- What the hell just happened? - Ah, I'm sure it was nothing.

I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.

We're not gonna finish playing Downbeat?

What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out,

"Downbeat"? No, thank you.

Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad? - Sure.

Morty, are you okay? You know what? Yeah.

I think if Dad really wanted to be here,

he'd stop at nothing to make that happen.

You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back,

or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight.

I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.

Yeah.

Hey, who wants to go run in a stream? What the fuck? No.

D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.

This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone.

I was raiding his hovel.

He had a chance to escape, but he looked back,

which is something we shouldn't do,

which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs

or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts,

but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back.

Thanks.

I know the perfect place for it,

which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bull[]

Am I right? Cool.

So, lots of hookers outside huh?

Is that what they are?

Ahhh! Hello there

Nice doggy.

You You want a snack? You You want my unemployment check?

You can tell the difference?

And you want this one? But this is actual food,

and this would nourish you.

And this it's just paper that only has value to me.

Unless my suffering is your nourishment? Jesus.

Okay.

Loser.

Morty?!

- Morty!

- Rick?

- Hey, Morty?!

- Rick?

Are you far away,

or are you inside something?

Is this a camera?

Is everything a camera?

Morty, the garage, Morty.

Come to the garage!

Morty?

Rick? W-where are you?

On my work bench, Morty.

Are you invisible and you're

gonna, like, fart on me?

Flip the pickle over.

What, I'm gonna touch it,

and you're gonna tell me it's

an alien dick or something.

Come on,

flip the pickle, Morty.

You're not gonna regret it.

The payoff is huge.

I turned myself

into a pickle, Morty!

Boom! Big reveal...

I'm a pickle.

What do you think about that?

I turned myself

into a pickle!

W-what are you just

staring at me for, bro.

I turned myself

into a pickle, Morty!

And? And?

What more do you want

tacked on to this?

I turned myself into a pickle,

and 9/11 was an inside job.

Was it? Who cares, Morty?

Global acts of terrorism

happen every day.

Uh, here's something

that's never happened before...

I'm a pickle.

I'm Pickle Rick!

♪

Are you going to,

I mean, you know,

is this the first part

of some magic trick?

I don't do magic,

Morty, I do science.

One takes brains, the other

takes dark eye liner.

Well, can you move?

Can you fly?

I wouldn't be much

of a pickle if I could.

All right, well, do pickles

live forever or...

Morty, stop digging for hidden

layers and just be impressed.

I'm a pickle.

I-I'm just trying

to figure out

why you would do this...

Why anyone would do this.

The reason anyone would

do this is, if they could,

which they can't,

would be because they could,

which they can't.

Morty, we have to get going,

or we're gonna be late.

Where's your grandpa?

Right here, sweetie.

I'm a pickle! What?!

Why would you... ugh!

Look, we're running late.

We have to go.

Where are you guys going?

We have an appointment

downtown

that was set a week ago

and agreed upon by everyone,

including you.

Oh, my God. Beth, oh,

it totally slipped my mind.

Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle.

I mean, I don't know

if I can... ooh, geez.

Rick, did you do this on purpose

to get out of family counseling?

- Morty!

- It's okay, Beth.

I understand

Morty's suspicion.

I've misled him before.

Morty, turn me so we're

making eye contact.

Morty, I assure you,

I would never find a way

to get out of family therapy.

I hope my lack

of fingers doesn't prevent

the perception

of my air quotes.

Can't you just turn yourself

back into a human?

Great question, Summer.

The unfortunate answer is

I did this

to challenge myself.

And it could take

hours or even days

before I'm able to figure out

how to return to human form.

But, I mean, you know,

your mom could put me

in a purse or a pocket,

you know,

if she really needs me to go.

Nobody needs anything.

Okay, it's fine.

I mean, you should just

stay here and figure out

how to stop being

a pickle, okay?

Hey, Rick, why is there

a syringe of mysterious fluid

hanging directly over you?

Also, why is the string

attached to it running through

a pair of scissors

attached to a timer?

And why is the time set

to 10 minutes from now,

exactly when we would

have left for therapy?

Well, Morty, if you know

must know,

the syringe is completely

unrelated to this discussion,

and, therefore, it does not

warrant further explanation.

Enough. Kids, it's time to go.

We don't want to be late.

W-w-what are you

doing there, Beth?

What are you doing there,

sweetie?

Well, I mean, you don't

want to get pierced by a needle

full of liquid unrelated

to your situation.

How's that gonna help?

Can't argue with that.

Great. We'll see you later.

Hey, hey,

be careful with that.

It's for something else.

It's really important,

so don't break it.

Okay, I may have

[bleep] up here.

Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut,

dah, pap, pap, pap, pah.

T-t-tah, tah.

Oh, great.

Stupid cat.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

I know what it looks like

to you, Izzy,

but I'm not a snake!

I've seen the YouTube videos,

I know cats are scared

of cucumbers and pickles because

they think they're snakes.

I'm not a snake!

I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!

Whoa!

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Oh, crap, that sun is bright.

Okay, come on.

This can't really be

the way I go out.

This is the mega-genius

equivalent

of dying on the toilet.

So hot.

This is how I'm gonna die.

Oh, God, moisture.

Oh, God, the moisture...

Dial it back, God.

Dial it back a little bit here!

Oh! Oh.

Oh, God!

Perpendicular, perpendicular!

Oh, shit!

Oh! Oh!

Oh!

Come on. That's it.

Come get this delicious brine.

Aah!

Come on!

Come on, mother-[bleep]!

Come on!

Yes!

How is this even

family therapy

if Dad's not invited

and Grandpa won't come?

Yeah, and what's courageous

about eating a hot dog?

It's nobody's choice

to be here, you knobs.

The family was told to get

counseling by your principal,

even though it's not

the family that was

huffing pottery glaze

in the art room

and desk wetting

in history class.

Oh, the Smith family,

minus a dad.

You're patients

of Dr. Wong, too?

Temporarily...

By order of the school.

Me too. How long have

you all been eating poop?

We... have never...

eaten poop.

Uh, me, neither.

Say, where did my family

get off to?

Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong.

Come on in.

I was told there was a grandpa

that might be joining us?

He got wrapped up

in an experiment.

He's a scientist.

Like, legit,

like on a an inter-galactic,

sci-fi level.

His work is very...

He turned himself

into a pickle.

Morty, Mom's talking.

I'm sorry.

I suppose that's a good segue

into our little

discipline cases here.

Does Grandpa turn himself

into a pickle a lot?

What?! No!

What kind of question is that?

The kind that wasn't designed to

attack or hurt you in any way.

Oh, Jesus Christ,

one of these.

No, my father has never turned

himself into a pickle before.

He's unpredictable

and eccentric.

The whole family is.

Speaking of which...

Okay, let's open things up

to the whole family,

and let me ask this.

Why do we think Grandpa

turned himself into a pickle?

Wow. Ugh!

Hey, listen, I know this

is your world not mine.

The sooner I can get out,

the sooner I can go back

to taking big craps, and you can

go back to subsisting on them.

You are one driven rat.

Could you be

a little more driven?

To the right.

Yes, yes, yes!

Come on, come on, come on!

Fresh, fresh, fresh!

Whoa, whoa, whoa,

was this your friend?

Don't worry, he died doing what

he loved, being a dumb... rat.

♪

Oh, yeah!

Aaaah!

I didn't say

my father is perfect,

I said his work is important.

And she's saying

what's important is

that Grandpa lied to you

to get out of coming here.

Oh, he did not!

Let's do an experiment here.

I get the impression

this family values science.

So raise your hand

if you feel certain

you know what was

in the syringe.

Raise your hand if

you know for certain

the syringe does not

contain anti-pickle serum.

Beth, your hand did

a little thing there.

Do you really not see

what's happening here?

Tell me. Well, Dr. Wong...

By the way, racist name...

Obviously, Morty and Summer

are seizing on your

arbitrary pickle obsession

as an end run

around what was supposed

to be<i> their</i> therapy.

Oh, I think

this pickle incident

is a better path

than any other

to the heart of

your family's dysfunction.

I think it's possible

that you and your father

have a very specific dynamic.

I don't think it's one

that rewards emotion

or vulnerability.

I think it may punish them.

I think it's possible that

dynamic eroded your marriage,

and is infecting

your kids with a tendency

to misdirect their feelings.

[Bleep] you.

- Mom!

- Mom!

[Bleep] both of you, too.

By the way, you might

notice that in spite of

your numerous

distinctive features,

I never gave you a name

like Scar or Stripe or Goliath.

That's because, to me,

you aren't special.

You were special to rats.

Now they're dead.

I guess it was me

you should have impressed.

God damn it, I love myself.

Pickle Rick!

Get that parkour.

Get that parkour!

Hey, it's cool.

Just need to find

the nearest exit.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

No need to freak out.

Whoa!

Who in the [bleep] toilet

is this?

What is it?

A pickle? A rat? Both.

It says it's a scientist.

Where is it?

It seems to be

using the air ducts

and the mail tubes

to get around.

It's been gathering

office supplies, we think,

to build weaponry.

But look what it

did on the mezzanine.

It transferred a bottle from

the trash to the recycling bin.

Whatever this thing is,

it's shaming us.

We have 34 armed guards,

and we can't kill a pickle?

32 armed guards.

He killed two.

It's on the phone.

Put him on, and locate

the phone he's using.

Hello.

<i>Hi, um, can you, uh,

please let me out.</i>

Your mere presence

in this building

violates international law.

<i>I couldn't let you out even

if you hadn't killed two men.</i>

You should know

those men killed themselves.

<i>And how is that?</i>

<i>They didn't

let me out.</i>

Solen'ya.

Shut your mouth

and do your jobs,

you [bleep] children!

Uh, is this not

a good time or...?

Some of my men

are calling you "Solen'ya"...

The Pickle Man,

an old wives tale.

He crawls from

bowls of cold soup

to steal the dreams

of wasteful children.

<i>That'd be

a lucky break for you.</i>

Go, shoot to kill.

Aaah!

We got him.

- Ah.

- Ah.

<i>Because this pickle</i>

<i>doesn't care

about your children.</i>

And I'm not gonna

take their dreams.

I'm gonna take their parents.

Solen'ya! He's coming!

It's because I threw

half-way my sandwich!

He's just a pickle!

He's a monster.

He's not the only one.

You can stay, dead to the world

and die in this room.

Or you can kill a pickle for me

and earn your freedom.

There is no freedom while

you're leader breathes.

Our country is a prison.

Then Catarina is a prisoner.

Perhaps I could arrange

her escape, as well.

She lives, Jaguar.

Where is this pickle?

What do you think is

in the syringe, Beth?

You're the one that costs

$200 an hour. You tell me.

- Anti-pickle serum.

- It's anti-pickle serum.

Your kids think it might be

anti-pickle serum.

My kids pee their desks

and suck on unbaked vases.

They're just angry at me

for divorcing their father.

I never said

I was angry at you.

That's the point of

pottery-enamel huffing, Summer.

You do it so you

don't have to say

"I'm angry at mommy"

out loud.

Oh, my God! Oh, there...

There's pictures of people

eating poop in there!

It's not my job to take

sides or pass judgment.

Do you think when your father

asks for that syringe,

you could ask him... He won't

have to ask for it, okay?

He won't need it.

He'll just make more.

He doesn't<i> need</i>

anything from anyone.

You admire him for that.

It's better than

making your problems

other people's problems.

Oh, come on!

Pickle Man, you should

know this isn't personal!

You should know

that isn't original.

They have my daughter.

There's nothing I won't do

to see her again.

Yeah, there's lots I<i> wouldn't</i> do

to see my daughter,

but killing you gets me

to her quicker

than your derivative

bullshit.

I never bullshit, Pickle Man.

This can only end

with one of us dead,

and I have never died.

That will be your

downfall, Jaguar,

not being open

to new experiences.

Is it done?

Jaguar?!

<i>Jaguar couldn't make it.</i>

Do it.

Okay, you win, Pickle Man.

I'm unsealing the building.

<i>No, thanks.

I'm coming for you now.</i>

Pickle Man, there's

$100 million worth of bonds

in a safe on level two.

I'll give you

the combination.

That money belongs

to the people.

Shut up and call me

a helicopter, you prick!

Do we have a deal?!

<i>Take that money,

give it to Jaguar's daughter</i>

<i>when you set her free.</i>

Or I'll be visiting you.

<i>Jaguar's daughter is dead.</i>

Huh, so you're a liar.

<i>Jaguar was an animal.</i>

You're an intelligent pickle.

We can do business.

<i>I don't think so.

See you soon.</i>

- Is the helicopter here?

- Yes.

And the police

are on the way.

What do we tell them?

Ooh! Aah!

Tell them we were robbed.

Hey!

Hey, what are you doing?!

I'm right here!

♪

Farewell, Solen'ya.

F-15s are scrambled.

This helicopter will be

shot down in seven minutes.

Well, my daughter

is about five away,

and I've got about

eight to live.

Pickle Man, it's too late

for me to tell my daughter

I love her, but not for you.

Oh, well, uh, she knows.

I mean, we don't really

buy into that kind of crap,

to the extent that love is

an expression

of familiarity over time,

my access to infinite timelines

precludes the necessity

of attachment.

In fact, I even abandoned

one of my infinite daughters

in an alternate

version of earth

that was taken over

by mutants.

Okay. Good luck with that.

Wait. Do I have

infinite daughters?

Huh? Uh, no.

No, nope, sorry about that.

Nope, just me.

Yeesh!

I...

am...

afraid...

that my kids

will get expelled.

Good. Summer, you go.

I am mad...

that I can't huff enamel

without people assuming

it's because my family sucks.

I hope to be seen one day

as someone that just

likes getting high.

Good job.

Morty, do you have

an "I" statement?

I am sad...

that I peed.

I'm sad that I peed in class

instead of a toilet.

Look at this family go.

You guys are pros.

What do you guys think about

doing this once a week?

Ugh.

You must be Rick. Mm-hmm.

I've heard a lot

about you today.

Your family

is crazy about you.

Your daughter holds you

in very high regard.

You're a lucky fella.

Yeah, thank you.

Uh, sweetie, you don't still

happen to have that

syringe in your purse?

Dad...

I would like you to tell me

what's in the syringe.

It's a serum that I need to,

uh, to stay alive.

I have had a rough day.

And, uh, I've sustained

a lot of damage.

I'm pretty close to death,

which the serum will prevent.

By changing you from

a pickle to a human.

Yes.

Rick, why did you lie

to your daughter?

So I wouldn't

have to come here.

Why didn't you want

to come here?

Because I don't respect therapy,

because I'm a scientist.

Because I invent, transform,

create, and destroy

for a living, and when

I don't like something

about the world, I change it.

And I don't think going to

a rented office in a strip mall

to listen to some

agent of averageness

explain which words

mean which feelings

has ever helped

anyone do anything.

I think it's helped a lot

of people get comfortable

and stop panicking,

which is a state of mind

we value

in the animals we eat,

but not something

I want for myself.

I'm not a cow.

I'm a pickle...

When I feel like it.

So... you asked.

Rick, the only

connection between

your unquestionable

intelligence and the sickness

destroying your family

is that everyone in your family,

you included, use intelligence

to justify sickness.

You seem to alternate

between viewing your own mind

as an unstoppable force

and as an inescapable curse.

And I think

it's because the only

truly unapproachable

concept for you

is that it's your mind

within your control.

You chose to come here,

you chose to talk

to belittle my vocation, just as

you chose to become a pickle.

You are the master

of your universe,

and yet you are dripping

with rat blood and feces.

Your enormous mind literally

vegetating by your own hand.

I have no doubt that

you would be bored senseless

by therapy, the same way

I'm bored when I brush my teeth

and wipe my ass.

Because the thing

about repairing,

maintaining, and cleaning is

it's not an adventure.

There's no way to do it

so wrong you might die.

It's just work.

And the bottom line is,

some people are okay going

to work, and some people...

well, some people

would rather die.

Each of us gets to choose.

That's our time.

I'm going to

give you guys my card

and hope to hear

from you again.

And if you have any friends

or family that eat poop

and would like to stop,

give them my number.

I, um...

I'm sorry I lied

to get out of the thing.

I... I shouldn't lie to you.

Oh, it's fine.

I mean, thank you,

and, yeah, you shouldn't.

But I hope you know

that's not what

that session

was supposed to be.

Oh, no, I mean, I know

it was Morty peeing his pants

and Summer snorting glue

or whatever...

She huffed enamel, and we never

even talked about it.

Well, there was so much

more at stake.

I mean, that shrink,

what a monologuist.

Are we gonna go back?

Sweetie, could I get...

Get that syringe now?

Oh, my God, yes!

Dad, it's in my purse.

Oh, I'm sorry.

You must be in agony.

Eh.

Jesus.

Jesus Christ.

Therapists, man.

Weird breed.

Man, I missed having hands...

and blood and a stomach.

We should get a drink.

Really? Like, go somewhere?

Yeah, let's drop the kids off

and go tie one on.

Absolutely.

I... I liked her.

So what are you thinking,

like, Smokey's Tavern?

Maybe Shoney's?

Yeah, either one. Either one.

You'll never get away

with this, Concerto.

That is where you're mistaken,

performance of all time!

This is it, Morty.

We're goners.

We're not getting

out of this one.

After everything

we've been through,

this is how we're gonna die.

Make peace with your god.

Oh, geez, Rick,

I-I-I don't want to die!

And now for the E-splat!

Jaguar!

Who? Who was that, Rick?

That, Morty, is why

you don't go to therapy.

Don't let any of those

Right, next time I need

a species sterilized,

you?

Whoa! Rick!

I-Is that

the Vindibeacon?

We're being called to assemble

by the Vindicators!

I refuse to answer a literal

call to adventure, Morty.

Let it go to voice mail.

Rick,

the Vindicators only call when

the universe itself is at stake.

They're the first line

of defense against evil.

They're the guardians

of the unguarded!

They're the writers of their own

press releases, Morty.

They're a bunch of drama queens

that spend an hour talking

and 20 minutes jumping around

while shit blows up.

They're a phase.

We did one, it was the big even

of that summer, let it die.

I, Morty Smith,

invoke my right

Read 'em and weep.

Fine. But don't say

I didn't warn you.

Yes! Vindicator Command Ship...

Beacon received.

We're doing

Vindicators Twoooooo!

Whoops.

Uh, Morty, you might want

to freeze some sperm.

Vindicators.

Worldender is back,

and this time he's out

to end more than worlds.

We have reason to believe

his stronghold is located on...

My balls. Rick!

The Terraneous system.

Once in range, Million Ants

will scan for pheromone activity

which should lead us

to the location of the base.

Oh, that's Million Ants.

I can't see the ants

from over here,

I just assumed that was, uh,

turd man,

wiggly turd man.

Rick, stop! Rick, you have

something to add to the briefing?

Uh, yeah,

just a few more design notes...

Um, this guy,

the, uh... the, uh...

I am Crocubot.

Right, Crocubot.

So, you're half cold,

unfeeling reptile, half...

also cold...

equally unfeeling machine.

Yes.

Wow. So, your origin

is what?

Y-You fell

into a vat of redundancy?

Got damn!

Noob Noob,

we're having a briefing.

If I can continue, Rick.

I anticipate sophisticated

security measures.

I trust

you can be of service there.

Well, let me check my list

of powers and weaknesses.

Ability to do anything...

But only whenever I want...

Yeah, that sounds like

a job for me.

I wish he had the ability

to check his attitude.

Happy hour.

Uh, I was also late

Man, that's hard to say.

And... Morty, right?

Whoa, yeah!

I never forget a kid.

What do you say, Vindicators,

let's make this three for three?

- Haha!

- Yes!

Did he say

"three for three"?

Did he say he never

forgets a kid?

You mean two for two,

right, Vance?

Actually, we assembled

a second time last summer

to fight Doomnomitron.

So this is...

Vindicators Three?

And you guys did

Vindicators Two... without us?

I sense... insecurity.

Are you sure there's not

just a picnic nearby?

I guess he found his crowd.

Pretty toothless stuff,

guys.

I hope you're happy with

the adventure so far, Morty.

These guys are even lamer

than last time.

We weren't here last time,

remember?

They did a whole Vindicators

without us.

A bunch of them got killed,

too.

They lost Lady Katana,

Calypso, Diablo Verde...

Yikes. Yeah, things did feel

less diverse in there.

This article says the reason

we weren't involved was...

"personality conflicts."

Don't worry, Morty,

they love you.

Superheroes need

a wide-eyed unremarkable

to tag along and react

to everything

like it's mind blowing.

I... think the personality

conflict might have been...

you?

Jesus...

How awesome is that?

I mean, they wanted

to not need me so bad

they murdered three

innocent heroes of color

and they still

had to bring me back?

Rick, since

it's my adventure and all,

could you do me a favor?

Uh, the adventure

is the favor, Morty.

Me sleeping on these linens

is the favor.

I mean, w-w-what... what are we

vindicating? Comfort?

Rick,

this really bums me out.

It-It's embarrassing to find out

these guys don't like us.

Why? Morty

I defeat gagoos

more powerful than these guys

every week.

Yeah, but not heroes.

Oh, please, they just call

themselves heroes so they can...

I'm calling them that, Rick!

They're my heroes. Mine!

Huh, no accounting

for taste.

I'm gonna go get a drink.

Good morning, Vindicators.

Ship has arrived

at Terraneous system.

All Vindicators report

to the... briefing room.

The... The room

from the, uh... the...

Uh, it's the d...

It's a different room than...

Than conference room.

I'm sorry, it's my first day

as a PA System.

First-day jitters.

Oh, God.

Good morning. Looks like your

grandpa had a long night.

Crocubot, why don't you

escort Mr. Sanchez

to a more comfortable spot

so that someone can...

clean up his diarrhea.

Oooh, I'm nervous

about my first mission!

Actually, Noob Noob,

you have a new mission.

Got... damn. Vindicators,

prepare for arrival.

Morty, the Vindicators and I

had a chat this morning,

and I'm afraid we need

to make a little change.

I-I totally get it.

I-I'm so sorry.

You should be.

Running around

in a yellow T-shirt

like you're not one of us.

Disgraceful.

I-I-I'm not a superhero.

Cop a squat, chief.

Everyone in the universe

is a hero.

All you have to do is know the

difference between good and bad,

and root for good.

Rick says good and bad

are artificial constructs.

Yeah, well,

I get the feeling...

He kind of needs that

to be the case.

Not coming, Noob Noob?

Ohh! No, uh,

I got stuff to do here.

Security drones, inbound.

Star Mother,

grant me your wrath.

All aboard!

Gun turret.

Are you all right?

Yes. I only lost 400 ants.

My queen is laying more.

I am back to...

one Million Ants.

Someone wake up Sanchez.

Ugh! Oh, Christ.

Rick. You're up.

Barely.

We're taking fire

from an automated turret.

Can you bring it offline?

Uh-huh.

Uh, my God, that's better.

Rick!

Hey, I can't help

if I can't see.

I could've just used

a ghost train.

Really? You don't say.

You would've used a ghost train?

Hey, everybody,

the ghost train guy

would have used

a ghost train.

- Man, [bleep] you.

- Is there coffee?

Hey, Morty,

can you be a pal,

Grandpa left his coffee maker

on the ship,

you know,

the French press thing...

Get it yourself.

Little extra snippy

this morning, aren't you?

Just focus on the mission,

all right?

Oh-oh-oh, I'm sorry,

oh, you're right.

Ohh, real serious.

Gotta take it real serious, huh?

Son of a Steam Engine.

They're all dead.

Why would Worldender do this

to his own men...

and several women? Well,

he is the Worldender.

The guy ends worlds.

Kind of his thing.

Ohh, real scared.

Real [bleep] on alert,

high alert over here.

Watch out!

What the [bleep]?!

It's Worldender!

What happened to him?

I sense his life force

is fading.

Million Ants,

ladies and gentlemen.

The ant colony with the power

of two human eyes.

All right. Short mission.

Good mission.

Remember when Alan

wanted to use a ghost train?

See you guys in Vindicators Four.

Morty? Rick, whoever did this

is an even bigger threat

than Worldender.

We can't leave now.

He's right.

This is far from over.

Well, have fun with that,

but Morty and I have to meet

a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man,

Two Assholes, and a

Full Alligator in like an hour.

Shit.

I sense the presence

of a greater evil.

Drunk

Check, check. One, two.

Okay. Is it recording?

Good.

Hello, Vindicators.

Welcome to your reckoning,

baby!

Official.

I had too much to drink

last night.

You're, you know,

the Vindicators.

So, now that we know... Rick?

What's going on, buddy?

Obviously, I came here

last night during a blackout.

"Obviously?"

You came here and defeated

our arch nemesis...

while so drunk

you don't remember doing it?

That's something "obvious"

to you?

Look, I'm a lit... little

more complex than you guys,

and, no offense,

but I've always suspected

that a lot of what you do

in a year

could be knocked out

in a couple of hours.

So I thought, why not

just do your job for you,

so we can have

a little fun game.

Rick, is...

Is this a "Saw" thing?

Are you seriously

Sawing the Vindicators?

Morty, I'm a drunk,

not a hack.

If you break the rules,

lose the game or try to leave,

you will die.

Like in "Sawwww."

Well,

I-I-I think we've seen enough,

I'll just figure out

how to unplug this.

Okay, here we go.

Room number one.

The Vindicators are known

throughout the galaxy,

but do they know yourselves,

do you know yourselves?

Match your... your shit,

your... your gimmicks,

with your faces, and y-you get

it, it's a matching thing.

And do it in three minutes

or you'll all die.

Screw this.

I'm not playing his game.

I'm gonna find us

a way out of here.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hold on, Vance.

He said you'd die

if you tried to leave.

That means

there's booby traps.

Why are you acting

like that's not you?

What part of "blackout"

don't you understand?

I thought you drank.

Like cool drinking!

Like sexy drinking,

not this psycho,

trailer-park shit!

Vance, stay calm...

Oh, so you're the leader now,

because we gave you a jacket?

You're the learning-disabled kid

we do photo ops with.

Okay, ouch, but...

Okay, this...

This is triggering me.

I need space.

I-I need space from this!

Give me one reason

why I shouldn't crush

your windpipe.

Because my epidermis is laced

with a nanofiber defense mesh...

And because, like I said,

I don't remember last night.

I told you not to invite this

mummified mother[bleep] back.

Alan, I'm not proud

of what's happening here,

but if you

keep coming at me,

there's gonna be another

passenger on that ghost train.

Guys! I figured it out.

- Congrats!

- You did it it!

It was a bit. All of the

descriptors apply to all of you.

Drunk Rick's point

is that none of you

are very special or different.

That's always his point.

Let's just get through this

as quickly as possible.

Then we'll deal

with the two of you.

The two of us?

I hope you're proud of yourself.

Uh, I kind of am. I saved

the God damn universe.

That's not the issue,

Rick!

Ahh, it would've been

if I hadn't!

The Vindicators say their job

is to fight evil

wherever it hides,

but they don't...

Pick the location you'll...

You'll never hear them

even mention,

because to fight darkness

is to fight yourself.

Oh! I know this.

Dorian 5!

Crocubot, don't!

There's no other

possible answer.

My mechanical and reptilian

logic are certain of it.

Oh!

Huh! I'm seeing more croc

than bot here.

God damn it!

Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?

Nothing!

Nothing? We exterminated

a planet.

W-Wait. Huh?

Doomnomitron was hiding there!

He's a shapeshifter.

Destroying Dorian 5

was the only way to kill him.

Come on, guys,

we're all thinking it.

Don't...

Don't make me say it.

Oh, okay. This again.

You know,

I could have made you a device

to detect Doomnomitron from

orbit like that.

I'm not the one that

didn't want you back. Alan was.

If you lay those deaths

at my doorstep one more time...

Do not threaten her.

Congrats, you did it.

What the hell

is "Israel"?

It-It's just something

Rick starts talking about

when he's blackout drunk.

W-What?

In w... In w-w-what?

Like,

w-w-what's my point?

In a way

that has no point,

you just babble about defense

budgets and the United Nations

and then you pass out.

So, to be clear,

I sometimes reference

the geopolitical complexities

of the topic...

Which is not the same as going

to an anti-Semitic place.

I have not stake

in this...

I don't either, I'm...

I'm just saying, if anything,

the drunk version of me is

probably so supportive of Israel

he wants what's best for it

and...

Hey, man, I'm not touching this.

You do you.

Aloha... means hello

and goodbye in Hawaii.

But, uh, aloha means...

Has nothing to do

with this room.

I'm so [bleep] drunk.

Ugh, okay.

Here's the deal.

I-I want to rest my eyes

for a little bit,

I'm...

I'm not going to sleep,

I just... just need

to rest my eyes,

so let's make this one

simple...

Just... try to hit

some three pointers.

Let's say... you have to

hit... five three pointers

in... five minutes... or...

I don't know,

the whole place... the

whole planet will get blown up

with a n-neutrino bomb.

And try to make it a-a lesson

about... yourselves,

like... like

how selfish you are...

Are or something.

And also Hawaii.

You guys hit the baskets,

I'll disarm the

drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb.

There's a 40 percent chance

it's a dud,

but y-you should still

stay back.

Morty, how many of these...

Too many, Rick! Too many!

Man, I am really getting

high-roaded today.

That's a three pointer.

Nice shot.

Thank you.

You two

make quite a team.

We all do.

Yeah, I guess...

That's a three pointer.

But you guys have always had

a... an unspoken bond.

I mean, really unspoken.

Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband

unspoken.

We aren't married anymore,

Alan.

Sure, but were we married

when you two were "stranded"

on Delphi Six for three days?

Because I sensed something

was weird when you came back...

But what do I know

about sensitivity?

I'm just

a phantom train conductor.

You're the pile of ordinary bugs

that [bleep] my wife!

That's a three pointer.

Where the [bleep]

is the lead wire?

You always put it

in the weirdest place.

Um, uh,

over here maybe?

Jesus Christ,

what a shitty neutrino bomb.

It's a miracle I ever

actually destroy anything.

Oh, I don't know,

you managed to destroy

just about everything today.

The villains, the heroes,

the lines between them,

my childhood...

Thank yeewwwwww.

I appreciate it, Morty,

I know you were sucking

the Kool-Aid

out of

the Vindicators' [bleep]

So the fact that I was right

about them

must be pretty hard

to admit.

Yeah, it is.

You know why, Rick?

Because

when you're an asshole,

it doesn't matter

how right you are,

nobody wants to give you

the satisfaction.

I know. Everyone wants people

they like to be right.

That's why popular people

are [bleep] dumb.

And why your pretentious,

poorly-written,

high-budget friends

back there

can eat a double-decker

shit sandwich.

Disarmed.

Holy shit.

You're jealous.

Yes! Is that

what you want to hear?!

Did it feel good?

Did you like his six million

wriggling legs

more than

my tragedy-stricken,

half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!

Guys, stop!

You're just proving

my asshole grandpa right!

You wish this was about sex!

We loved each other!

We had a child together!

What?!

I conceived a child with Million

Ants and it died inside me

because it was half a million

ants and half collapsing star!

And yes.

He was better than you.

Yeah?

One... million...

times... better.

All aboard, mother[bleep]

Stop!

Oof!

Didn't see that coming.

Is that sarcasm?

I don't want you slipping away

when this is over.

All of these deaths

are on your hands.

Okay, come on,

maybe a couple of them,

but definitely

not the Train Guy.

Oof! All of them.

Oookay.

Congrats. You did it.

All right, by now,

I've been pretty clear

that I think the Vindicators

are full of shit.

But... you do have one thing

that I'll never have.

And that thing is the only part

of the Vindicators

with any value to me.

If you know what it is,

place it on the platform.

Guess wrong

and pla-planet will explode.

And probably the solar system,

'cause I kind of [bleep]

eyeballed the neutrino bombs

on this one.

So what's the trick? Morty,

you're the Drunk Rick expert.

I think... no matter

what we put on there, we die.

He said it's the part

of the Vindicators he values.

That means nothing.

He wants

our last moment alive

to be spent knowing

how few [bleep] he gave.

Jesus! Okay,

open to second opinions.

It could...

It could be Morty.

What?

Hey, I don't know.

I mean, look,

when I get drunk,

I get stupid and emotional

and there's no logic to it.

It's, like,

it's possible I got so drunk

I felt like I was losing Morty

to the Vindicators,

and maybe this is

my way of saying, "Okay",

you can have him but only if

you know how important he is,

"otherwise I'll kill you."

That is a...

really specific guess.

Look, I-I... there's

nothing in the room but us.

I'm just using logic

to connect some dots,

it's the best guess

I've got.

But you're betting our lives

on it.

I'll cover that bet.

I get it.

Well, Morty, I think

you're doing that smirky face

because you're misinterpreting

the moment.

I am not being coy

about some hidden love for you.

I want to be really clear that

if anyone has a better guess,

like, if I gave you

an amulet last night, or...

Phew.

Oh, shit.

Sorry. I'm... not good

at goodbyes,

and... I'm drunk,

so, you know, I just...

It looks like I'm never

going to see you again.

I can't really roll

with the hero types.

And I don't... they...

They don't want me around.

But I want you to know, even if

I didn't show it at the time,

I really appreciated

you sticking by me.

God damn it, why am I crying?

It makes no sense.

Ugh, you're...

You're probably confused

because we barely

knew each other,

but you really

stuck your neck out

when you gave me props

for my awesome jokes

in the briefing room.

Everybody else had their head

so far up their ass.

Even my own grandson is like,

"Oh, the Vindicators,

they're so cool."

I mean, he's a moron,

that's their demographic.

But you're different,

Noob Noob.

Mother [bleep]

You're [bleep] cool.

And you're smart.

And I bet

we coulda hung out and shit.

And I hope you get to be

a full-fledged Vindicator

and... and do...

Do me a favor,

don't... don't let them know

I-I got emotional.

But you can tell them

one thing.

Tell them I said...

Oh [bleep] Okay. I just

shit myself. Okay, later.

W... Dude, Morty, what

happened... Shut up.

I sense this means

we are not dying.

Not all of us.

Sweetheart.

Just let Titty Bean do this,

Snuzzles.

It's for the greater good.

Greater good?

Titty Bean?

It's like you said, Morty.

There's no right or wrong...

Never said that.

It's the galaxy's faith

in the Vindicators

that keeps

the galaxy secure.

Yeah,

I feel safer already.

No doubt, who do we make

the check out to?

I will say we are getting

some good licks in

while choking to death...

Right?

Titty Bean.

Listen to me.

When you came to me,

I was merely

a sentient colony of ants.

It was your beliefs,

your pursuit of justice...

that taught me

to be a man.

When did it get

so complicated?

Who knows.

But we can make it simple again.

You were always

the romantic.

Which is why you can't leave,

either.

I'm sorry, my love.

Damn! She double-crossed

Snuzzles!

Silence!

I'm going to enjoy this...

Let's

give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez

for killing Worldender, putting

this awesome party together,

and for booking one of

the hottest talents out there...

- Logic!

- Awe, yeah.

Look at that.

It's going down.

Geez, I must have planned

a whole party.

- It's Logic, y'all.

- Invited a bunch of people.

- Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.

And I'm pretty sure

we don't need Vindicators.

Don't mind if I do.

Yeah!

Yo...

D-Did I get paid yet?

Whoo!

I can't believe we're getting

Gear Cream with a Vindicator.

So, you girls in Gear college

or Gear...

Alien terror attack!

Okay. Sounds like

a job for... me.

I better go

get into my alter ego.

So cool.

I know.

Wait, what alter ego?

He was already wearing

the jacket.

Gotta know when to hold 'em

and...

Aaaaah!

Did you get any of that?

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

Jerry!

Jerry, come on!

We got to go!

You got to come with me, Jerry!

Rick?

It's important, Jerry.

The fate of the galaxy

rests on your shoulders.

Let's go.

Put some pants on.

N-Never mind, there's no time

for pants, Jerry.

I'll make you a pair of pants

on the way.

It's a Rick and Jerry

adventure!

Rick and Jerry episode!

Then I thought,

"Hey, what about Jerry?

He's... He's good

with regular folk."

This is a real situation

where... where...

Where Jerry

could really shine.

"He's a master convincer."

Rick, I'm not an idiot.

I know what this is.

Oh. Okay, well,

I told Morty,

"Look, parents get divorced.

They get sad. He'll be fine,"

but I think he's worried

you're gonna, you know... Pbht!

And you know how Morty gets

when he gets emotional.

It impedes my work.

So, I told him I'd take you out

and give you a win.

Wait. My son asked you

to take me

on some kind of

pity adventure

to keep me

from killing myself?

Wait, w-what

did you think it was?

An execution.

Geez!

You really do need a win.

No!

I-I don't know.

I mean, you never made me

the pants, so...

So, you thought

I was gonna drive you

into the middle

of the galaxy

and shove you

into the vacuum of space

with your dick

hanging out?

And we're seeing

how you'd act

if that were

about to happen?

I mean [bleep] I'll make you

the pants right now.

Take me two seconds

to make you pants.

I have pants at home!

Jerry, if I make pants,

they'll be better than

your pants at home.

Also, if I wanted

to kill you...

Yeah, I get it.

It would be amazing.

Please, take me home.

I'll tell my son we had

an amazing adventure.

Well, if it's

all the same,

could we go

get our story straight?

Because

you're a terrible liar.

You called me

a master convincer!

You believed me?

Huh. This seems...

kind of fancy.

Jerry, for all you know,

this is the equivalent

of an alien truck stop.

You have

no frame of reference.

You're in a universe

beyond your imagining.

But, yes,

it is super fancy.

I mean, my job here is

to make Morty happy.

I'm not gonna take you

somewhere dangerous.

Rick Sanchez.

I told you if I ever saw

your face in here again,

I would stick you

like the pig you are.

Shnoopy Bloopers,

I told you if you tried...

There'd be two funerals.

Aaah!!

Someone?

Uh, someone?

Someone!

My friend!

It has been too long.

Oh, it's great

to see you again, buddy!

Yeah, you're doing it.

Mr. Sanchez gets

anything he wants!

The resort's covered

in an immortality field.

You can't die here.

That's the gimmick.

Okay, but still...

Bad parenting.

Hey, rich a-holes are

rich a-holes.

They all pay top dollar

to come here

and enjoy a consequence-free

vacation.

No death, no disease,

no dismemberment.

Can't even have

a heart attack.

Got it.

The perfect place

to take the most fragile being

in the universe.

I can tell you expect me

to refute that,

but it's

right on the money.

If I come home

without you,

I doubt Morty's gonna

let me off the hook.

Yeah, but what if you came home

with Jeff Goldblum.

Jeff Goldblum?

What the [bleep] are you

talking about, Jerry?

Jesus!

Holy [bleep] shit!

Yo, what's up,

"Big Chill"?!

Don't go

into the telepod!

Hey, maybe we would have fun

on a fake adventure.

On a<i> fake</i> adventure.

Speaking of...

What are we gonna tell Morty?

I don't know.

But whatever it is,

we're gonna need a couple more

of these babies!

What's wrong?

Mom,

do you think I'm hot?

I... don't think that's something

that matters.

So, I'm not hot?!

I'm saying the part of you

that cares about that

is a part you shouldn't

give any energy to.

That's not an answer!

Because I'm not an issue

of<i> Cosmo,</i> okay?

I'm your mother

and a doctor, and...

I'm hideous!

Geez.

What's with her?

Teenage-girl stuff.

Is that a...

hoof collage?

It's perfectly legal, if that's

what you're wondering.

Cool... zies.

"We just don't have anything

in common any more, Summer."

Oh, yeah, Ethan?

What do you have in common

with Tricia Lange?

A mutual love

of French cinema?

The belief

that a carbon tax

is the only viable solution

to climate change?

Or could it be

her massive stripper titties?!

There it is.

Boob-ya!

And that's when

Malakai the Squid came,

rips off his face,

and beneath it is my face.

I liked it.

Thank you, sir.

Yeah, of course he likes it.

Look at him.

Mother[bleep] got two heads

and three trunks.

All right,

we'll put a pin in it.

I'm gonna

go take a leak.

What the...?!

My hands are dry!

My hands are dry!

My name is

Risotto Groupon.

I am the assistant general

manager of the restaurant.

Do you have

any comment cards,

because I might have

some thoughts.

My kingdom was

usurped by force

with weapons

and technology

supplied by

<i>your</i> father-in-law!

Hey, he usurped

my kingdom, too, man.

He basically got me kicked out

of my home, stole my family.

Then we are brothers,

and you have wondered

what your life could have been

without Rick.

Wondered? Sure.

I mean, I've wondered

about having a vagina.

Would you help me

kill him?

What? No!

He's my wife's father.

Move on.

Do you...

like theme-park rides?

Oh, you really moved on.

There is a popular attraction

here called the Whirly Dirly.

Between the first whirly

and the third dirly,

the ride dips just outside

the immortality field.

You're asking me to lure Rick

to his death?

I'm only asking you

to go on a ride with Rick,

get off the ride without Rick,

and go home to your family,

where you can...

wonder about having a vagina.

Okay, okay, that was

a very specific example

pulled from thin air.

I don't want to be known

as the vagina guy.

Risotto, you're needed.

Someone ordered

the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh

and Fluzzy Special.

Look, I'm not like Rick,

so you're free to do

as you please.

But there comes a time

in every man's life

when he must choose

the foundation

on which his legacy

will be built...

One of compromise

or one of blood.

That's what I'm talking about.

Oops! Okay, a little more

on the other side then.

Oh, come on!

Oh, geez!

Aah! Stop!

So, the hospital just let you

walk right out of there

with horse parts

in a bag?

For Christ's sakes,

Morty,

women going through

a divorce

need a creative outlet.

What was that?

Summer!

I'm coming, Summer!

What the hell

happened?!

How do we get her

back to normal?!

I don't know, man! This thing is

pretty complicated.

I-I'm gonna call Rick.

Well, hold on.

We can't just call your grandpa

whenever

there's a problem.

We can handle this

ourselves.

I mean, I don't see the point

in trying to.

This is obviously

Rick-level [bleep]

I have

a medical degree.

Is that

what this is about?

L-Like, you want

to prove yourself?

Oh, it's not about anything,

Morty. How dare you?

Okay, good.

Then I'll just call... Ow!

Morty, I need this.

Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here

says he knows a place

where the ladies drop panties

for anyone bi-pedal.

Yeah, I'm

not really interested.

My heart still belongs

to Beth.

Oh. Huh. Okay.

What, you don't think

I have a shot?

I didn't say that.

Excuse me.

May I have another one of these?

Coming

right up.

Hmm, things weren't always

so bad between Beth and me.

We had some good times

when we were younger.

Oh, yeah, I bet.

That's how teenage pregnancy

happens, my friend.

Yeah, no.

Things were pretty great, even

until a couple of years ago.

Jerry, I get it.

That's around the time

I moved in with you guys.

Oh, I guess

you're right.

Jerry, you know,

I hope you're not suggesting

that I had anything to do

with your marriage breaking up,

because there are some major

issues between you and Beth

that have been there

since you guys met.

Hey, to

new beginnings.

To the Whirly Dirly.

The Whirly Dirly?

All right,

what's going on here?

When did you get cool?!

When you stole my wife!

I should have done that

a long time ago!

We're going on

the Whirly Dirly!

Whirly Dirly, baby.

Aha, look at this.

It says "normalize."

I bet if we

just press that...

But... if the machine was made

by spider people,

normal would mean

eight legs.

Oh, God! Are you gonna

go on another spiel

like you did

with the flesh-colored crayon?

I'm pretty sure "normalize"

will make her normal.

Aah!

I'd call that progress.

She's huge!

And normal!

I'm not normal!

Mom!

Okay, this says "reverse."

Done and done.

I don't think

that's a good idea.

Oh, come on! What else

could "reverse" possibly mean?

Aah!

Mom, call Rick!

Thank you.

There's a customer-service

number on here.

Mom!

Oh, man.

This is gonna be awesome!

I got to hand it to you, Jerry.

This was a solid idea.

Uh, yeah.

Uh-huh.

And you know what?

I'll cop to it.

I put a lot of strain

on your marriage.

It wasn't fair.

I'm sorry.

What?! I didn't respect

your marriage.

I certainly

didn't do it any favors.

And for what it's worth,

I'll apologize to Beth for it

when we get home.

Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!

Stop the ride!

We got to get off.

What are you

talking about, buddy?

We got to get out of this thing.

We got to get out!

Jerry, come on, man!

We haven't even gotten

to the first whirly.

No, no, this sucks.

It's so boring.

I mean,

I'm falling asleep here.

Let's just get out and crawl

down the sides.

Uh, get down!

Duck down!

It's more fun

when you scrunch down.

Jerry, what the...

Oh [bleep]

Rick, up here! There's

a spot where you can kill him!

Good call, Jerry!

Hey, how'd you know

about that?

Uh...

Lisa?

So, uh, Jerry, big fan

of the Whirly Dirly, are you?

Not anymore.

Obviously.

But when you were,

how did you know about it?

We had a deal,

Jerry Smith.

It's a<i> really</i>

common name.

Now, take it easy, Rick.

You've been in a serious

roller-coaster crash.

It's... It's no time

to be thinking about

who did or didn't play a role

in your attempted murder.

Get it off me!

It's eating me!

Look, I confess, okay?

They told me about all the

bad stuff you did to this planet

and reminded me of all

the bad stuff you did to me.

But then you said

you were sorry, and I realized

you're not a monster...

Not like this thing.

[Bleep]

It's got me good.

This is a mislead,

right?

You're inventing a thing

to save me.

That would be called

a knife, Jerry.

It's been invented.

I'm making a way out of here...

One seat ought to do it.

I'm sorry.

I-I made a mistake.

I won't do it again!

Nobody ever does.

You self-righteous

piece of [bleep]

You took my family!

I took<i> your</i> family?

Who do you think

had more taken from them

when you shot 20 ccs

of liquid dream-killer

into my daughter?

She was<i> Rick's</i> daughter, Jerry.

She had options!

Oof.

That all ended

because she felt sorry for you.

You act like prey,

but you're a predator!

You use pity to lure in

your victims!

That's how you survive!

I survive

because I know everything.

That snakes survives

because children wander off,

and you survive

because people think,

"Oh, this poor piece of [bleep].

He never gets a break."

I can't stand

the deafening silent wails

of his wilting soul.

"I guess I'll hire him

or marry him."

- Rick!

- Rick!

I knew you wouldn't

let me die.

That was never an option.

Because you never had

a son.

No, because I need

a living organism

coated in gibble snake bile

to attract a shmooglite runner.

Wait, what's happening? Use

that confusion, Jerry.

It'll make you wriggle more like

an abandoned newborn.

Jesus Christ!

What the [bleep] Rick?!

Help!

Help me!

Aaah!

There's a space port

20 miles south.

We'll be able to board

a galaxy class cruise ship

and jump through a wormhole

that will put us

within spitting distance

of the Milky Way.

But, hey,

it's about the journey,

not the destination,

right, Jerry?

Just stay put, sweetie!

Mom's still on hold.

Morphizer customer service.

How may I help you?

Yes, I'm having a little trouble

with one of your machines.

Oh, I'm sorry

to hear that, ma'am.

Do you see a little compartment

on the side of the machine?

Let me check.

Yes, got it.

Mom?

Great! Now, do you see

the little button next to it?

I do. Give that button a push.

Okay.

Mom, listen to me!

We're free!!

Okay, so I pushed the button,

and three little men ran out.

What do I do next?

Hello?

I think

we got disconnected.

Morty!

Don't "Morty" me!

I tricked Rick into taking Dad

on an adventure

because I thought

I could get a break

from this kind of [bleep]

but no!

Like father,

like [bleep]damn daughter!

You want to be like Rick,

congratulations!

You're just as arrogant

and just as irresponsible!

Everything

okay here?

Mind your own [bleep]damn

business, Gene!

I'm having a conversation

with my mother here!

Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna

help him keep him around,

Mom, but it will help you lose

everyone else.

Like I lost Summer.

Hey, you haven't

lost her yet.

No, I definitely did.

She's gone.

God damn it!

Go ahead.

Oh, come on.

What's happening?

Your friend is class C or above

cybernetic augmentations.

Emphasis on the above.

In any case,

he needs to be neutralized.

What?! Wait!

Ugh!

Brain hurty.

What did you do?

It's a synaptic dampener

that blocks violent tendencies

and controversial thought.

He will now be

an ideal passenger.

I want cookies

and a 90-minute cut of "Avatar."

Seriously?

Quit it. It'll wear

off in six hours.

It's cheaper than banning

dangerous people from flights.

I mean, let everybody

buy a ticket, right?

Otherwise,

the terrorists win.

Aah!

I'm sorry I'm not

a classic maternal archetype.

Okay, I don't know what to do

when you people come to me

with your weird

puberty issues.

What are you gonna do

when your daughter asks you

if she's attractive?

I'll say "yes"!

Morty, gross!

Well, she's

gonna be super hot.

Her mother's gonna be

Jessica...

Wait, when did Summer

ask you that?!

Right before she Clive Barkered

herself. Why?

Wait,

I know where she is!

Ethan and Summer were

supposed to go camping,

and then he dumped Summer

for this girl, Tricia Lange,

who's got huge boobies

and took her.

Campsite... The one with the

name that sounds like somebody

gave up halfway

through naming it.

Uh... Camp Flabanabba!

Mama's coming, baby.

Mama's coming, and she cares

about your titties!

They have

sweet smiggle honey cookies.

Mmm! And low-calorie

petroleum flakes.

Obviously cookies.

Let's get you

the flakes then.

Okay, but it's not

what I wanted.

Well, maybe next time,

you won't be

such a dumb piece of [bleep]

and you can pick for yourself.

That's not nice.

What's that?

Did you just have

a controversial thought?

No. That's what I

thought, bitch.

You little punk-ass.

This is the best.

I agree.

You've made things even easier

than if you hadn't

been incompetent.

Uh-oh.

We get shoot-shoot now.

<i>All right, folks, if you

could please take your seats,</i>

<i>we're about to enter

the wormhole.</i>

<i>So, I hope everybody bought

it dinner first.</i>

Nice.

Nice.

Jerry, step over there

and lock yourself

in the escape pod.

You're not killing us?

I'm killing Rick.

You're free to go. You're

no threat to me or anyone.

Now you're

just being mean.

Yeah, you're mean...

No offense.

Mean would be

shooting you, Jerry.

This is

saving a bullet.

Go back to

your quietly ashamed family

and live out

the rest of your days

in denial

of your vagina fantasies.

It was a one-time thought

that everyone has!

What are you doing?

I'm being

triumphantly brave!

It's not triumphant

or brave.

You're not risking

anything.

You might shoot me.

I think

you know I won't.

Because you know

I feel sorry for you.

You're just doing this

so you can tell yourself

you fought... Ow!

<i>Temporal shield compromised.</i>

Congratulations, Jerry.

You get to die a man.

Uh, that's okay!

I'll leave!

Please don't shoot.

I-I'm the vagina guy, remember?

Whoa!

What is happening to me?

Where is this?

Where am I?

Am I dead?

A-Am I... Am I still alive?

Those aren't the questions

you should be asking.

Huh?!

Shh!

Ah, got ya!

Come here,

you little pumpkin.

I have shit on my ass.

Whoa, oof this!

Who am I?

Who am I?

I'm time!

I'm literally time!

Whooooa!

Aah!

Oh, God. I feel like

our souls were united,

and we were all one

with eternity.

Our body's unchanged,

yet our minds have lived

a thousand lifetimes.

Is that enough time

for me to forgive you?

I don't know,

but it's enough time

for a synaptic dampener

to wear off.

[Bleep]

He hadn't decided

he was still going to kill us!

He was talking himself into it.

I've seen it before.

Cosmic apotheosis wears off

faster than salvia.

I'm starting to believe you

because I just finished merging

with your essence

for an endless epoch,

and I'm already back to thinking

you're an asshole.

Fine with me.

Let's just go our separate ways.

Sounds like you

and the word "epoch"

have a lot

of catching up to do.

Wait, don't leave me!

<i>All right, folks,

you're free to get up</i>

<i>and walk around the cabin</i>

<i>and maybe take the wormhole out

for breakfast.</i>

<i>Okay, you can do the dinner one

or the breakfast one,</i>

<i>but not both.</i>

You think you got that thing

figured out?

Yeah, I know

what I'm doing.

Good.

Because I have an idea.

It's actually a contraction

of "some" and "more,"

you see that?

Oh, wow.

I was way off.

Morty,

what's happening here?

Summer got into

my grandpa's garage,

messed around, and

turned herself into a monster.

My mom did the same

to make her feel better.

She's a good mom.

Oh, my God.

I have to go call my mother!

Tricia, wait!

Ethan! Ethan!

Hey, it's okay.

Sit down.

You made

my sister cry, Ethan.

You messed with

her body image.

Look, Morty, I...

Shh, shh, shh.

Careful, Ethan.

Your s'more is burning.

Uh, I guess we better

get on the same page

about our fake adventure.

Right.

I'll make you a deal.

I'll leave out the part

where you tried to murder me...

And I'll leave out

the part

where you admitted

to sabotaging our marriage.

You want to...?

Nah, if the family

sees me like this,

they'll

feel sorry for me.

Which is no longer

my signature move.

Later days, amigo.

Actually, I just realized,

I don't have my wallet,

and my bus pass is in there,

so maybe...

Stay strong, Jerry.

I believe in you!

I tell you, fellas.

This is the life.

It certainly is.

To freedom!

Ooh!

Looks like a 4-22.

Ooh, a couple cranks

on scaling knob

with a four dilabyte cross fade

would fix that in a jiff.

Four? You'd be lucky

to clear 13% de-morphized

with that

kind of range.

Gentlemen, gentlemen,

what did we agree on?

No work talk!

Let's just relax and enjoy

our retirement, shall...

Oh, my God!

Aaah!

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

So, Jessica,

I heard you broke up with Brad.

Who are you gonna date

now that you can date anyone?

I don't know.

I mean, obviously if someone

special comes along...

B-But I mean

<i>really</i> special, like,

nothing I've even remotely

considered in the past.

Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. I want that

kind of love like that docking kind of love.

Oh, yeah. Like, penis in the

foreskin kind of love...

Mm-hmm... just, like,

warm, just like...

He...

Everybody [bleep] off.

Morty, I need your help.

W-W-W-We... We need to go

on a quick adventure.

You said

I could go to school today.

That was before

I needed something, Morty.

There's a plasma shard

in the Abadango Cluster.

A princess has it.

If I get it, I'll be awesome.

We've been going non-stop, Rick.

It's not healthy.

You know,

these are my teenage years.

I-I just found out

Jessica's single.

Oh, that's... Wow, Morty. Wow.

What an exciting life you lead.

Let's go. In and out,

20 minutes adventure.

They're on our tail!

Steady, Morty.

Five cetons.

Steady, God damn it!

Two cetons.

Wha!

Fire!

Pull up, Morty, pull up!

Pull up!

[ Bleep ]

Oh, [Bleep]

[ Bleep ]

Ahh! Ahh!

I can't [bleep] do

this anymore!

That was seriously [bleep] up.

We almost died.

So you agree? [Bleep] yes!

That w... T-This was insane!

That was pure luck.

I was not in control

of that situation at all.

Look at this, Morty.

Look at my [bleep] hand.

Look at this shit. Why do

you keep doing this to us?!

I don't know, Morty.

Maybe I hate myself,

maybe I think I deserve to die.

I-I-I-I don't...

I don't know!

We need a vacation.

Isn't that something?

You were right...

Best day spa

in the galaxy.

It's not even cruel, either.

These things are just doing what

they do in the wild...

It loves swallowing

stressed-out creatures

for 20 minutes

and then puking them up.

My whole body's

like a baby's ass.

Complimentary

psychological detox?

Removes

all your cognitive toxins,

purifies your system.

Oof, this guy on commission

or something?

I don't think...

Are you on commission?

We're not on commission.

We get paid by the hour.

There's no incentive

really...

Oh, my God.

Okay, listen...

W-W-W-We'll try

the machine,

but... but I'd like you

to try something.

Try swallowing

the giant ball of snot

that's dangling around

in the back of your throat.

It's disgusting.

Nobody wants to hear that.

That's what you do. Okay,

Rick, come on. Enough.

Man, did you hear me bite

that guy's head off?

Geez, I really need

to chill.

Maybe you should go through

twice.

All right, mister comedy man, you don't have

to bust my balls. You're not helping things.

Rick, is this thing

supposed to be making this...

Morty!

- Ri-Rick...

- Morty!

What happened?

We blew up, idiot!

Are you really that stupid?

Obviously the guy I yelled at

overloaded the machine.

It takes more than that to kill

Rick and Morty, mother[bleep]!

But this might do it.

Run, Morty!

E-Everything hurts!

That's because

you're worthless!

Jesus,

how big was this explosion?

I'm a genius. I don't have time

for this [bleep].

W-W-We're in Hell,

aren't we, Rick?

- You're so stupid, Morty.

- You're an idiot.

There's no such thing as Hell.

I believe you,

but I just want to die.

You can die when I say so.

I control you.

I control the universe!

Why am I bragging about that?

I have nothing to prove.

I'm surrounded by inferior

pieces of [bleep] and...

Toxins.

We're not in Hell, Morty.

We're in the detoxifier.

The machine didn't blow up.

It worked normally.

It removed our toxins.

<i>We're</i> the toxins.

Are you listening,

you stupid little

garbage person?!

We're what got removed!!

I hope you both found that detox

sufficiently relaxing.

Hey, man, listen... Those comments

I made about your throat?

It's all good.

It's nice of you

to let me off the hook.

It's still unacceptable

behavior, and I do regret it.

Believe me, man, I've been

working here a long time.

I get it.

Hey, uh, you mind

if I put on some music?

Not at all.

♪ Grab my terrifolds ♪

What is that?

I just hit shuffle.

Are you kidding?

- This universe.

- Oh, excuse me.

We should listen to one random

song a day, you know?

We'd end up hearing

more songs we didn't like,

but we'd discover

a lot more that we did.

That is

an interesting concept.

You know,

it makes me wonder

if there's

an algorithmic expression

that could achieve

the ideal ratio.

Listen to me...

Trying to calculate

happiness over here.

Hoo, if anyone could,

Rick.

Hey, here's something

no science could measure...

I'm real proud

to be your grandpa, Morty.

Thanks, Rick.

I love you.

Yeah, mother[bleep]!

Yeah! Get it! Get some!

Right up your [bleep] bitch ass,

you [bleep]!

Guess who just discovered

a new element?!

You think you could do that,

Morty?

You think anyone but me could do

that ever in a billion years?

Do you think if God existed

he could do it?

The answer is no.

If God exists,

it's [bleep] me.

Yes, Rick.

I-I agree, Rick.

While you were flapping

your parasitic turd holster,

I discovered the toxic equivalent

of electricity, Morty.

What do you think

about that?

Uh... I th... I think my voice

is annoying.

It is,

<i>and</i> it's your best quality.

So true.

Now, who can tell me

the common denominator

of these two factions?

You don't know

or y'all just bored?

Hey, listen, you know, wha...

If we're all bored over here,

wouldn't the common

denominator be you?

Damn, Morty.

That's hilarious.

Normally I would come down

on any kind of disruption,

but it seems to represent

a positive change

for your character.

Class dismissed!

- Awesome, Morty!

- You done good, Morty.

Oh, yeah!

Thanks for the advice, Morty.

You got it.

I did it, Morty!

I knew you could.

Hey, Morty,

remember yesterday

when I couldn't

play the trombone?

Well, check this out!

Just like I told you,

Mitch...

The music was in your heart

the whole time.

Stupid hat... Wish I had

the courage to just be myself.

There you are.

You might have

all these idiots fooled,

but I know you're still

the same pathetic loser

hiding behind

a confident facade.

I know that because...

I'm doing the same thing,

brother.

I'm not alone anymore!

Hey, Morty. Word around school

is you've become super healthy.

I don't know

about all that.

I do, however, know that I have

a pretty bad case of

haven't taken you

to dinner-itis.

Might be fatal.

Hey, kids.

Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.

Morty,

a moment of your time?

Happy to help, Rick.

I hate to bug you

with this,

but after our morning hike

I started receiving very faint,

highly unusual transmissions

on my sub ether phone.

Listen.

It's a bad phone.

Chuck it.

I downgraded to a clamshell

for emergencies only.

You know, if... if... if

something's worth saying,

I-it's worth eye contact.

Uh, I-I-I traced

the source of the call

back to the spa

we went to, Morty.

I thought I could hear

a voice in there,

so I enhanced it,

a-and listen.

Hey, asshole!

Oh, man!

Remember us?

Oh, I don't like confrontation!

You [bleep] us,

you pieces of garbage!

That's right,

you're [bleep] garbage, not us.

I'm a [bleep] genius

and a god.

You really think

this thing can hold me?

I'm gonna rip

your throat...

Morty, what if the toxic parts

of us have their own identities,

their own will to live?

W-What if mine shares

my intelligence

and devised a way

to reach out to us?

Sounds like

he's in a lot of pain.

Lot. O. Pain.

But, you know, you shouldn't

have to deal with that, man.

You know,

l-let's work off your trauma

with some urban spin yoga.

It's amazing.

You do yoga on a bike,

but you have

an at-risk preteen...

I don't think I can

just blow this off, Morty.

If I had known it worked this

way, I wouldn't have detoxed.

Well, I would have

because I was toxic.

Now I'm detoxed and I'm

accountable to my toxins, right?

I-It's a dilemma.

I think I know what to do.

Morty!

Rick!

You know, the only problem here

is a big fat brain

that misses eating

all them big fat problems.

Focus on the good thing.

Trust me, things are good.

Taking that away from me...

...that wouldn't be

healthy.

Oh, man. World's Greatest

Grandpa, for reals.

It's not just a coffee cup

for you, bud.

You're legit.

I love drums.

I never took drum lessons.

Why? Limitations. We are

addicted to our own limitations.

How amazing is that?

Is the kale prepared

in the kitchen?

I'll have a water.

Uh...

How is the...

"cru-dite?"

Crudité.

It's a cup of carrot sticks.

Ha! It's okay!

Pronounce it however you want.

Words are just things.

Please. Thank you.

We're having

a conversation.

God, I am so excited

to finally have dinner with you.

You know how long

I've been waiting for this?

It's like, whew!

I-I-I wish you'd shut up,

though.

Just kidding. You know,

you're so quiet. What's wrong?

W-Why don't you tell me

about yourself?

What's the atmosphere like

on planet Jessica?

Where's the equator,

what are the vacations,

a-and the holidays?

I mean, you know,

are they the same time?

Talk to me. Well... I...

like this restaurant.

Holy [bleep]! Holy [bleep]!

We have a moron over here!

I'm an idiot.

I can't believe I haven't

thought of this.

You have to do

this detox thing I did.

It's an alien spa,

you go through it,

fwoos-s-s-ssh,

lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa...

...sucks everything out.

Everything that was holding me

back, everything bad,

I mean, it just...

Right?

Cooooool.

Oh, my God!

I can't believe this.

Yeah, phones are awful,

I downgraded to...

I totally forgot my...

I have a... thing, and...

Things are good. You know what?

Why am I doing that?

That's more rude

than the truth.

Look, I'm sorry, Morty.

I just don't think...

Do not. Even.

You have no need to explain.

It's all good. I think

you'd get bored with me.

E-Exactly.

Look, the sparks aren't flying.

This is what dating is for,

you know?

First date, no sparks.

No damage, no worries.

Life is a highway.

We're gonna ride it

all night lonnngg!

Gonna eat some "crudite."

Mmm!

Is this organic? Mmm.

All right.

You know, the

evening continues.

Okay, here we go.

Ma'am, I'm afraid I have

some bad news for you.

Your money's no good here.

I'll... I'll get the next round,

sir.

Aren't you a child? Only

in the ways that matter.

Morty.

Stacy.

I've been watching you drink,

Stacy.

I get the feeling

you've got a hard job.

I wonder what it takes

to please you.

That's the job I want...

Part time, full time,

I want to be good at it,

bad at it,

I want to get promoted, fired,

corner office, hostile takeover,

workplace accident...

I'm on my knees, Stacy...

Praying, worshipping, begging,

whatever you want.

What do you think about that?

Okay. [Bleep] it.

Tink.

Mm!

Let's ask my grandpa.

He's a scientist.

Hey, Rick, are you familiar

with "Ben Wa" technology?

Morty, great news.

I went back to the spa

and they let me purchase

the containment unit

from their detoxifier.

Why? Because we're

coming home, bitch!

What is this? This is the parts of

your pussy grandpa that keep it real.

Oh... oh, and I think you

dropped something, too!

I don't want to be

on camera.

I'm ugly and gross,

please.

Should I go? You're

your own person, Stacy.

Then I'd like to stay.

Rick, please tell me

you're not trying to put

that stuff back inside of us.

Morty, I'm sorry. That stuff

is alive and it belongs with us.

We yanked them from their homes

and locked them in a can.

Mother[bleep]!

See?

They're living in pain.

That's what they do, Rick,

they live in pain.

They<i> are</i> pain, you know?

They... they're all the bad

parts of us, which, by the way,

includes our dishonesty,

so how do you know this isn't

all some sort of crazy trick?

Oh, so now because I'm made

entirely of toxins I'm also a liar?

[Bleep] you,

you little sociopath.

You hear this, Morty? Oh,

everybody hates me. I can tell.

Y-You all hate me... All

right, shut up, Morty.

Healthy Rick,

are we doing this or what?

Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you

to step into the booth.

Don't negotiate

with that little turd, dummy.

You're the Rick.

You need to show dominance.

Morty, booth, now. Booth!

Come on, Morty.

Don't touch me!

Morty, do the healthy thing and

voluntarily retoxify yourself.

Nooooo!

Is it wrong if I think

this is kind of hot?

Let me out of here!

Stacy, help! Open the door!

I need to hear our safe word,

Morty.

Sea Cucumber!

Sea Cucumber!

What are you doing? I'll do

anything for you, Morty.

No!

It worked! Yes!

That idiot believed every word.

Now let's see how<i> he</i> enjoys

living in that shit tank.

He's right behind me,

isn't he?

He's in<i> front</i> of you. Oh. My

eyes are still adjusting.

Uh, is this like

a sex dungeon?

I guess I should've been

paying attention.

After 70 years

of being bottled up

inside a

sentimental jackass,

I finally get to live

my own life.

You said we were merging. I lied,

dumbass! I lie about everything!

Why would I ever re-merge

with a pussy like you?

So... you were just gonna trap us

in that tank?

T-That was your plan? Not<i> was,</i>

mother[bleep]... still is.

...Kill him, Rick!

I don't like this!

This is scary!

All right,

you asked for it.

Did I ask for this?

Did I ask for this?

Huh? Did I?

<i>Assessing threat to groin.</i>

Groin System 6000.

Kill him!

<i>That... is my groin's user.</i>

Believe me, I got a lot more use

out of that thing

than he ever did.

<i>You know what?

Not my table.</i>

<i>You</i> do<i> know me.</i>

What the hell,

Grandpa Rick?

[Bleep] you, Summer!

Sorry, Summer!

Okay, okay, take it easy.

Don't do it.

I love you. Good boy.

Daddy's little boy.

Summer,

get out of here! Go!

Oh, who's that?

Who's

that over there?

Oh, no. You see the bad man

in front of you?

You're a good little boy,

you're gonna get him.

You're gonna get him.

Ahh!

Son of a...

Ahh!

Nice try, asshole.

We can resolve

our issues.

We don't need to resort

to over-the-top...

Aah!

I-I did it, Rick.

I got the tank!

I-I'm a piece of [bleep],

but I got the tank!

You're going in that tank,

mother[bleep].

You're gonna live in

that toxic [bleep] wasteland

like I had to do!

Ahh!

Ow!

That's right, mother...

You're going in that [bleep]...

Dads?

Okay, just...

Just leave her out of it.

What's going on?

All right, [bleep] this.

Time for plan B...

If I can't trap you

in a toxic world,

I'll just make the whole world

toxic.

It's okay, girls.

I-I'm so sorry I put us in

danger with some of my behavior.

I-If you'd like I can go out

in the g-garden,

pick some fresh basil,

and make us a nice Scallopini.

What did the booger version

of you mean

when he said he was going

to make the whole world toxic?

Believe me, sweetie, that man's

motivations are a mystery.

Screw that, Rick.

We got to stop him.

What's the last thing you'd think

about doing with that tank thing?

Morty, I appreciate

what you're trying to do,

but it's not our place,

you know,

to pick and choose which world

gets saved from what apocalypse.

Our... our toxins have as much

a right to their worldview as...

Morty, how is it healthy

to slap me?

Obviously my

version of health

is a hell of a lot different

from yours,

you useless old turd.

Wait. That's it.

How could that detox machine

know the difference

between healthy and sick for

everything that goes through it?

It can't.

It must be by the individual's

own definition of toxicity.

That means...

Dad! What the...

What the hell, Rick?

I'll explain on the way.

This "Moon Tower," Morty,

is the perfect height

and metallic composition

for the amplification

and beaming of toxic energies.

What do you think about that,

Morty?

Are you excited about that,

Morty?

Oh, man. I'm just freaked out.

I-It's too high up here.

Once I flip this switch,

the entire world is gonna

be just as toxic as us, baby.

As we praise

our loving Father...

God is a lie!

We made him up for money!

Santa Claus isn't real.

You were all mistakes!

We [bleep] did it, Morty.

Put your [bleep] hands

in the air.

Yeah, you little piece

of [bleep].

Remember me?

Didn't you learn last time

that you can't beat me?

Yeah, I did. And then I learned

something else.

- This.

- Ahh!!

That bullet is laced with an

encrypted nanobotic virus

that will disintegrate your

Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.

You think I give a [bleep]?

I know you give a [bleep],

dummy.

Because I know I don't.

Here's another thing

I know...

The decryption key

that neutralizes the virus.

You want it?

Come and get it.

Merge with me and you'll know

how to save him.

Pfft. Come on, man.

I've been trapped

in your pussy brain

for 70 years of delusions,

but this is the all-time weakest

bluff that I've ever...

Ow-Ohh!! Jesus Christ!

What are you doing?!

He's cutting your time in half.

10 minutes. Ohh! It hurts!

What is your problem?

Oh, I had all my problems

removed... my entitlement,

my narcissism,

my crippling loneliness,

my irrational attachments.

They must be somewhere.

They ain't over here, bro.

I'm not going back in there!

Honestly,

I don't care either way.

I hate having you in me.

And when I say "honestly"

you can believe it,

because we both know

I'm too healthy to lie.

Watch.

All right! Knock it off!

You're not impressing anyone.

Morty, not that I give

a [bleep], but are you okay?

Jesus Christ, it hurts.

Relax, quit your bitching.

Y-You're gonna be fine.

Grandpa's here.

You think that's funny?

Y-You got to have a sense

of humor about these things.

Oh, wait, you can't.

You're literally incapable

of seeing the bigger picture.

I guess it's just funny

because you've never done

anything but complain

about me being in charge,

but if I ever gave you the wheel

we'd be dead in five minutes.

- Rick?

- You poor, dumb, sick animal.

Rick?

Ahh! Just do it!

Just do it, you piece of...

I'm back, baby! Regular Rick!

Master of both worlds!

Check it it out!

"Excuse me."

Now we'll just reverse

this hacky toxicity beam.

Man, I really over think shit

when I'm angry.

Oh, give it to me.

Mm, ma-mah.

God is<i> not</i> a lie.

Mommy! Mommy!

Ha! All right, Morty,

now it's time we re-merge

your little ass.

You're a better man

than me, Rick.

I'm healthy

enough to admit that!

That kid is a

real piece of [bleep].

Y-Y-You're gonna save me,

right?

Part of me wanted to,

Toxic Morty.

Part of me

really wanted to.

I'm telling you,

these shares are hot. Yeah.

That sounds like a good idea.

It's definitely a good idea.

Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it,

now can you get me?

Have I ever lied to you?

That's right, and ask around,

I never do, Duane.

Let me put this real simple.

This stock is a beautiful

redhead, recently single,

not looking to date

but ready to fall in love,

and fate has put her locker

two down from yours, Duane...

Two lockers down.

So step up or

step off, Duane.

Blue pill or red pill,

what'll be, bro?

Totally understand, Duane.

You're the boss.

Heinholz Biotech...

Million and a half

at thirty-three.

Heh.

You little [bleep] monster.

Mmm! Is this organic?

Mmm!

Go for Morty.

Hi, Morty. It's Jessica.

Look, can we just talk

for a minute?

Is that how long it takes

for Rick to trace my location?

Come back, Morty.

I miss you.

You miss the old me.

You miss someone

that loved you so much

you never

had to love 'em back.

How do you know

I don't want to love you?

Because I'm not sick.

Ex-girlfriend?

Should I be jealous? There's

nothing to be jealous of.

I just realized that I'm scheduled

to speak at that fundraiser

on our date night.

I can cancel. We'll be together.

That's a date.

You are the perfect man.

Oh, sweetie, I think you hit

the wrong button.

You didn't hang up.

Huh. How 'bout that?

Sorry, tiny American Psycho,

time to take the opposite

of your medicine.

Do what you got to do.

Oh! Ow! Ahh!

So, how do you feel,

Morty?

Ah, geez. I'm miserable.

Am I good or what?

I guess it's worth it, though,

to know how much you care.

Care? Me?

Morty, I'm fine with you.

I only did this for him.

You lying bitch.

She kept coming to our house,

Morty, and kept asking me.

"Did... did... d-did you get

a new Morty yet?"

Because you kept drunk dialing

me and crying about it.

I wasn't crying!

Jacquelyn, I...

I-I-I wasn't

who I said I was.

You weren't a 14-year-old boy

from the Midwest

who ran away from his family

and capitalized

on his lack of conscience

by becoming a stock broker?

Oh. I guess I was pretty

up front about that, wasn't I?

You were up front

about everything.

You were my soul mate.

Well...

N... Not anymore. I'll, um...

Y-You can keep the apartment,

and... and... and,

uh... the drones.

She can't keep the drones.

They turn into

a little Voltron robot.

They're awesome.

You can't keep the drones.

So, how was your date

with Brad?

It wasn't a date.

We were just having lunch.

You guys are getting

back together, aren't you?

Morty, I need your help

on an adventure.

Eh, "need"

is a strong word.

We need door stops,

but a brick would work, too.

Okay.

Morty.

Good to have you back.

Have you ever been peed on

before?

Oh, my God. Yum.

you ready for our adventure

to the Lost City

of Atlantis?

Ready as I'll ever be,

Rick.

Oh, for [BLEEP] sake.

Hello, I'm Rick K-22.

This is my Morty.

We're going from

reality to reality

asking Ricks to contribute

to the Citadel of Ricks

Redevelopment Fund.

What are you, stupid?

We're done with

the Citadel of Ricks.

I was never on board

with it in the first place.

That's why

I murdered everyone in charge

and left it to rot.

Oh, that was you.

They tried to murder him first.

Aw, geez.

Well,

you'll be happy to know

that the council's

gone now...

Yeah, he knows.

<i>He</i> murdered them.

You want to rein in your Morty?

Every day.

The Citadel of Ricks

Redevelopment Fund

donates... Morty, he's not

gonna donate.

You're pitching

the Policeman's Ball

Let's go. You don't

have to be a dick.

I think you know that's not true.

Geez.

I didn't know there were

still Ricks and Mortys

living on the Citadel.

I wonder what their

day-to-day lives are like.

Well, you can keep

wondering that

while we go

on a fun, fresh,

self-contained adventure

to Atlantis.

Anyone continuing to explore

the Citadel is either stupid

or one of

the unfortunate millions

held hostage

by their terrible ideas.

Citadel Morning News.

News about the Citadel

in the morning,

pretty self explanatory.

Good morning.

I'm Rick D-716B.

And I'm Rick D-716.

Must be nice.

Coming up, gravity outages

in East Sanchez Heights...

And, is your uranium-powered

cellular matrix

making you sick?

The answer

may not surprise you.

It's...

Yes, it's uranium.

Those stories and more,

after this break.

60 iterations

off the central finite curve,

there's a Rick

that works more with wood

than polarity plating.

His name is Simple Rick

but he's no dummy.

He realized long ago

that the greatest thing

he'd ever create

was his daughter.

I love Daddy!

We captured that moment...

We run it on a loop

through Simple Rick's mind...

And the chemical

it makes his brain secrete

goes into every Simple Rick's

"Simple Wafers" Wafer Cookie.

Come home to

the impossible flavor

of your own completion.

Come home to Simple Rick's.

Just one day remains

before our

newly democratic Citadel

elects its first President,

it's anyone's race

among the Rick candidates.

But a certain

other candidate

should be getting

at least one vote

for most adorable.

That's right.

The Morty party candidate's

still in the race,

and you just gotta

love him for that.

Here you see him in his little

Morty suit waving...

Isn't that adorable?

Little jackass.

Uh, yeah,

I think we actually have

the audio

for his speech here...

Aw, geez. Aw, man.

I'm gonna lose the election

and stuff.

We had a good run, sir,

but I think it's time

to pull out of the race.

I feel pretty confident

about tonight's debate.

You shouldn't, sir.

You should be terrified.

Maybe you should find

a little faith, young man.

You don't pay me

to have faith.

And we're the same age!

- Aah!

- Whoa!

Oh. Sorry.

I-I was expecting...

A Rick partner?

Lesson one, rookie,

expect the unexpected.

Now, get in.

Mortys are human!

Get the [BLEEP] off the car,

you Rickless [BLEEP] animal!

Whoa! Morty Cop: The election's

got these yellow shirts

more riled up than

a picture-day Jessica.

That's pretty harsh, sir.

So report me.

Nobody gives a [BLEEP]

Look, I'm just saying,

it makes me a little sad

to hear a Morty cop

calling Mortys animals.

Well, it makes me sad to hear

another Rick cop

buying into his

sensitivity training.

Well, I'm glad to know

there's more like me.

Oh, there was one.

Why do you think that seat was empty?

<i>Robbery at Fifth

and Avenue.</i>

Fifth and

That's Morty Town.

Unit seven responding.

Ohh!

Good idea, Rick.

Good idea, Rick.

This is a great adventure.

This is a great adventure.

I love being

your new Morty.

I love being

your new Mor... Farty.

Very amusing, Mr. Smith.

Almost as amusing as

when your first Rick

was decapitated on

Zorpantheon Nine.

Or was that

your third Rick?

How many Ricks

have you had?

Five. I see.

So you<i> are</i> top of the class

in something.

Tomorrow you'll be

transferred to your new Ricks.

Hopefully

they will be your last.

Yes, Slow Ri...

Tall Morty?

Di... did I gradgitate

this time yet?

Anything's possible,

Tall Morty.

I guess we won't be seeing

each other after this, huh?

I say we make

our last day count.

I say... we go to

the Wishing Portal.

That's a myth.

It's not a myth.

My first Rick's fourth Morty

knew a Rick

whose Morty went there.

If we're not here

for graduation,

our butts are gonna wind up

in Morty Town.

I thought your last Rick

fused you with a lizard,

not a chicken.

Okay, fine. I'm in.

Me too.

What the hell?!

I thought I saw a fly.

Listen up, [BLEEP] nuts.

I've been your supervisor

for five years,

but all shitty things

must come to an end

and I have been promoted

to regional manager.

Yeah, I feel the same way,

may be never meet again.

Of course,

that makes the position

of supervisor available,

so, as of next week,

the ass you'll be kissing

will be that of...

K-83, affectionately

known as Cool Rick.

I know

I'm new to the Citadel,

and some of you might not think

I put in my time,

but what can I say?

I'm Cool Rick!

Yo! Ha! Ha!

Check me out!

All right knuckleheads,

any questions?

All right, then, back to work,

you gold rickers.

No Ricks, no families,

high off their asses,

and running amuck.

Mortys are raised

to be sidekicks.

Without a side to kick,

they just start kicking.

They were...

They were about my height,

around 14 years old...

oh, their... their shirts

were yellow!

Yeah, make sure

you get<i> that</i> down.

Any mutations,

augmentations?

Uh... Three eyes? A tail?

Maybe a buzz cut?

No.

Just four normal Mortys.

Normal?

Put it in your blog.

Let me turn over

a few rocks.

Aw, geez.

Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?

Aw, geez, man.

Nothing, man.

We're just hanging out

and stuff.

I hear that. Aw, geez.

I guess I'm supposed to be

figurin' out

who robbed the store

across the street.

But, aw, geez,

I don't know.

Aw, geez man, that sucks

that your Rick's

making you do that.

He's not my Rick.

He's my partner.

Aw, geez.

Well, maybe the uniform

makes a big difference,

who am I to say.

To me, you just look

like a sidekick.

Whoa! Call me a

sidekick one more time!

Call me a sidekick!

Hey, man! Come on!

Aw, geez!

Wanna see

how I paint a wall?!

It was

the Morty Town Locos, man!

The... the Morty Town Locos!

Aah! Aah!

Do you realize how many codes

you just violated?

Aw, geez, Rick.

What do I know about

knowin' stuff?

Get in the [BLEEP] car.

More lasers.

You could take more time

to answer the question

if you like.

Okay, Juggling Rick,

how would you solve

the Citadel's financial crisis?

First off,

can I just say

that I believe this Citadel

is the greatest

in the entire multi-verse.

Now, I believe

the answer to your question

has three parts.

First, education spending

must get<i> much</i> higher...

<i>But it has to be balanced

with defense...</i>

<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i> Can we fact

check this please?

Never mind.

Who am I kidding.

This race is over.

And that's how you run

a Citadel!

Candidate Morty,

the number of displaced Mortys

is soaring

while Rick satisfaction levels

are plummeting,

and the divide

between the two groups

has never been wider.

Solve that one real quick.

I don't see a divide

between Ricks and Mortys...

Oh, shocker.

I'd like to offer

a re-buttal.

Gentlemen, gentlemen,

I think we can all agree

on one thing...

Well, it came out

as two things

but you get the idea.

You guys finished?

The division I see

is between

the Ricks and Mortys

that like

the Citadel divided...

and the rest of us.

I see it everywhere I go.

I see it in our schools

where they teach Mortys

we're all the same,

because they're threatened by

what makes us unique.

I see it in our streets

where they give guns

to Mortys,

so we're too busy

fighting each other

to fight real injustice.

I see it in our factories

where Ricks work for a fraction

of their boss' salary

even though they're identical

and have the same IQ.

<i>The Citadel's problem

isn't homeless Mortys</i>

<i>or outraged Ricks.</i>

<i>The Citadel's problem

is the Ricks and Mortys</i>

<i>feeding on

the Citadel's death...</i>

Holy [BLEEP]

He's headed for the flavor core!

<i>But I've got

a message for them,</i>

<i>from the Ricks and Mortys

keeping it alive,</i>

<i>a message

from the Ricks and Mortys</i>

that believe in this Citadel

to the Ricks and Mortys

that don't.

You're outnumbered.

Holy [BLEEP]

I don't believe it.

I-I<i> can't</i> believe it.

I know.

That's why you're fired.

Sounds like

you're looking for work.

I can offer you

a very enticing

compensation package.

First,

let's talk benefits...

Daddy loves you.

That's Daddy's good girl.

Your life is a lie, man.

All your life's are lies!

Don't you get it?!

They told us we were special

because we were Ricks,

but they stripped us of

everything that made us unique!

We know how you feel.

We're working-stiff Ricks

just like you.

But our assembly line

is justice.

What are your demands?

I-I-I want a portal gun.

Unregistered, untraceable,

with enough fluid to take me off

this God damn prison!

The media's outside.

Well, keep 'em there.

Anyway, so yeah, the suspect

says the Citadel's a lie,

built on lies,

and some other shit.

I say appreciate

the life you have,

because it can always

be worse.

Back to you, Ricks.

Thank you, Rick 0716-C.

That [BLEEP] guy.

Tell me about it.

Meanwhile,

in election news,

an unexpected turn of events

as Morty

from the Morty Party

soars to

the top of the polls.

- Morty! Morty! Morty!

- Yes.

Morty, what's your original

reality and where's your Rick?

Gosh, we moved around so much

it's hard to remember.

I see every Rick

as my Rick,

<i>I hope they see me as their Morty.</i>

Another? Please?

With less water?

Hey, cheer up, pal.

A Morty's

gonna be president.

Imagine this kisser

getting blamed

for everything.

I guess I should've had

more faith.

It's not faith you need.

It's fear.

What's this?

It's secrets.

Wh... wh... wh...

What do you think it is?

Look at how I'm dressed.

<i>Having taken aim

at the system,</i>

<i>are afraid at all

for your safety?</i>

<i>I'd rather

live in hope than fear.</i>

<i>If I had to fear anything,</i>

<i>I'd fear other people

being afraid.</i>

<i>Of fear. Itself.</i>

<i>But. No, I'm not afraid.</i>

Hey, Rick, man,

when there's a Morty president,

you gonna lick my balls

or what?

Sheeeet, grandson,

you keep me peelin' skrabquams

and slippin' nib nibs,

I'll lick whatever

ain't nailed down.

Hands in the air!

What the hell, man?!

What the hellin' hell?

You guys doing a little

chemistry homework

with Grandpa? Is this

what I think it is?

Bootleg portal fluid.

I guess his math was off.

Search the place.

Are... are you...

my new... R... Rick?

It's okay, Morty.

Jesus.

He stabbed me.

He got me bad, Morty.

Shh. It's okay.

You're okay.

You were right.

Everything I learned at the

academy was... Doesn't matter.

Nothing's wrong with putting

your faith in a Morty.

You just gotta pick

the right one.

Why is there a crib

in here?

Something they do.

To make you feel bad.

Boy, I got us knee-deep

in paperwork, huh?

Go to the car

and grab a medi-pack.

Let me worry about this.

What happened?

Same old story...

Mortys killing Mortys.

Almost... got it...

Hey!

Y'all get the hell away

from my damn mega fruit!

Sic 'em, boy!

I don't wear

this dag-nab hat

and commit

to this rural character

so you can eat for free

while you come of age!

I bet the Wishing Portal

leads to a reality

where they're...

Where all...

Where it's a bunch of

French toast with boobies.

I bet it leads to a place

with a bunch of fry...

Fly... flies everywhere.

Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere.

I bet it's a big hole

where the Citadel dumps

all its broken dreams.

Slick, why do you have to be

so dramatic?

You wanna know why?

Because of this.

I'm part of

an experimental line of Mortys

with a drama implant.

How do you think it feels,

Fat Morty,

to know that

no matter where I go,

I'll always be the one

that makes everybody sad

and a little bored.

Slick, that implant

isn't who you are, okay?

You also

roll up your sleeves.

I thought

I was Left-Handed Morty.

Then you should

use your left hand

to eat more vegetables.

Hey, there. How you doing?

Great to meet you.

I'm a plumber, sir.

I'm a Rick,

and I'm a plumber.

That doesn't sound like

Rick work.

You didn't come to the Citadel

to be a plumber, did you?

Ha! Ha!

I sure didn't, sir!

Mr. Morty! Mr. Morty!

I cloned myself so you could

kiss me as a baby!

This is just like

a Morty baby!

Hey, did you, uh,

end up getting a new job?

Yeah, I did.

Assassinating you.

I'm okay...

I'm okay...

I'm...

Aw, man. Aw, geez.

Aw, hah.

You look like you could use

a good time.

One dance for $10,

two for $25.

No, thank you...

And bad math.

Ha! Ha! Yeah!

This is a good time!

What is this place?

The Creepy Morty.

What is it your kind's

always saying...

"Don't think about it."

Come on.

There's someone important

I want you to meet.

Ah, Bubbala!

How'd it go with

the Morty Town Locos?

They had

a little accident.

They won't be causing

any trouble anymore.

Those were bad Mortys.

Very bad Mortys.

Big Morty

likes to contribute

to keeping the peace

in Morty Town.

Think of him

as a "drug lord"

and us as

cops on his payroll.

Morty...

- Which Morty?

- Which Morty?

M... m... my partner.

Morty, you're right.

Morty Town is bad.

But that doesn't mean

that we have to be.

Hey, what's going on here,

Morty?

- Which Morty?

- Which Morty?

The cop, morons!

Don't worry about Rick,

Big Morty.

He's new.

He doesn't understand

how it works.

That's what you said

about your last partner.

Why would you say something

like that, Big Morty?

You're [BLEEP] things up for

both of us here. Wrong.

He's [BLEEP] things up

for both of you.

Unless he takes

the money.

Big Morty,

you're under arrest.

S... smartest man

in the universe.

They're just props!

Th... they're just props!

Not so

big now, are ya?

I never was!

It was figurative!

That's enough. If we don't

kill him, he'll talk.

If you do, I'll talk.

O... one thing's for sure,

Y... y'all don't have to worry

about Cowboy Morty talkin'.

This little cowpoke's gonna

mosey up on out of here.

You told me to put my faith

in the right Morty.

I've got faith in you,

partner.

Do the right thing.

Oh, Grandpa Rick,

I-I don't wanna be

on the Citadel anymore.

I wanna be a regular kid.

I-I wanna to go to school

and throw balls around

and masturbate.

What the hell happened

in there?

Same old story.

Ricks killing Mortys.

Okay, man, okay,

we got your portal gun.

What the hell's

he doing?

Where... where am I?

A bad place.

But you're going

to a better one soon.

Hey! Hey!

No, no, no, no...

Whaa...

God damn it!

A portal to

the blender dimension?

That's the oldest trick

in the book!

I'm a Rick!

I'm more Rick than any of you!

Then you should know you just

killed your only leverage!

Then comes and get me,

mother[BLEEP]

Stop.

I'm Rick D. Sanchez the Third,

owner of this here

wafer establishment,

and I say that the Rick in there

is right.

He's more Rick

than any of you.

He's a terrorist!

What Rick isn't?!

This Citadel

was founded by Ricks

for Ricks to be free!

What's your name,

young man?

Rick. And I'm... The

same age as me, I know.

How long have you worked here?

15 years.

What the hell

have we become?

Whatever time

you were gonna make him serve,

he's served it.

It ends now.

Come with me, friend.

Where are we going?

To your new life.

Which starts with walking

the [BLEEP] out of here.

Yo J-22, give 'em hell!

There's a Rick

that held a factory hostage

after murdering his boss

and several coworkers.

The factory made cookies,

flavored them with lies.

He made us all take a look

at what we were doing.

And in the bargain,

he got a taste of real freedom.

We captured that taste,

and we keep giving it to him

so he give it

right back to you,

in every bite of new.

Simple Rick

Freedom Wafer Selects.

Come home to the unique flavor

of shattering

the grand illusion.

Come home to Simple Rick.

It is real.

After you.

There it is.

The Wishing Portal.

They say for your wish

to come true,

you have to give up something

really important.

For me,

that's my panini maker.

I wish for

a million sandwiches.

And, yes,

I see the irony.

I guess

I wish I had something cooler

than this dumb-ass

surfer necklace.

I wish incest porn had...

Had a more mainstream

appeal.

For...

For a friend of mine.

None of those things

are gonna happen, you know.

Morty wishes

never come true.

Not on the Citadel.

Then why did you

bring us here?

Because I wish

that would change.

I wish anything about this life

would change.

Well, I hope you're

putting something

pretty God damn important

in there.

Me too.

But I doubt it.

- No!

- Slick!

M... maybe...

maybe it went

somewhere nice.

<i>Garbage dump.</i>

<i>Stand back.</i>

He had to be stopped.

He... he cou... he c...

Couldn't be allowed to win.

Then you should've

worked on your aim, bro.

He's alive? No, no, no.

You gotta listen to me.

I-I worked for him.

I was his campaign manager.

That Morty

is not what he seems.

Yeah, well, no Morty

seems like a president.

He... won? Yeah.

It was a blow out.

I would hardly call it

a blow out.

It was almost close enough

to trigger a recount.

Jesus. What are you

joke security now too?

Why am I still here?

I heard he confessed

to everything.

Your case has been reviewed.

You're free to go.

But... I violated at least

a dozen departmental codes.

New department.

New codes.

New Citadel.

Did we miss graduation?

Where are the new Ricks?

No graduation.

No new Ricks.

The school's curriculum is changing.

To what?

I don't know,

and I don't have to know.

I've been fired.

Good luck, turds.

Holy crap.

Slick's wish came true.

Sorry I'm late,

Mr. President.

Had a little crisis at work.

Worth it!

It's no problem.

Uh, a little more

off the top.

You were saying,

Garment District Rick.

We were saying,

"President" Morty,

that we don't care

who sits in that seat.

A Rick, a Morty,

a god damn Jerry...

It doesn't matter.

We've been running the Citadel

since before the council

and you'll find that we're

still running it now.

Does he really speak

for everyone here?

- Mm-hmm.

- Yeah.

Well, I think it's important

to be clear.

Raise your hand

if he speaks for you.

Is... that enough

off the top?

I don't know. Is it?

- Yes, yes, god damn, yes.

- I think it's great.

Good.

This seems like

a good time for a drink

and a cold calculated speech

with sinister overtones.

A speech about politics...

About order...

Brotherhood...

Power.

But speeches

are for campaigning.

Now is the time for action.

♪ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

Whoo! Yeah!

Atlantis, baby!

That was amazing.

You got some of that

mermaid puss.

I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off

thing and I can see her again.

By the way, hey, um,

you're still not

curious about what

what might've happened

at that crazy Citadel place?

Psh. Not at all, Morty.

That place will never have

any bearing over our lives

ever again.

Unlike that mermaid puss!

Whoo!

Yeah! We're going back for seconds!

Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

We're gonna do that shit

every week, man!

That was Atlantis!

Oh, shit!

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

Morty, hurry!

Return the Truth Tortoise!

Morty, whatever you do,

don't drop the Truth Tortoise!

Also really important,

whatever you do,

don't look into its eyes!

I... I did look at it, Rick!

I've been looking at it!

Now you're gonna know

everything, Morty!

Good job! Way to go!

You [BLEEP] everything up!

It's in my head!

Ah!

Oh, geez, I... I can't get that

Truth Tortoise out of my head.

Yeah, I told you not

to look into its eyes.

Hey, Morty, let's watch some

interdimensional cable.

Remember how we used to do that?

Rick, I can't...

I can't go on.

I-I can't go on like this with the

Truth Tortoise shit in my head.

I-I wish you could just...

Erase the memory from your mind?

How did you know

I was gonna say that?

Come on, Morty, come with me.

After you.

What the hell is this?!

This, Morty, is my archive

of all the experiences

you've begged me to remove

from your life,

lest you go insane.

I call them

Morty's Mind Blowers.

And we'll be doing this instead

of interdimensional cable.

How long have I been asking you

to remove memories?

Since the first time

your mind was blown.

Ahh, here it is.

Classic.

There's no dust on it because

this isn't the first time

we've done this.

- What?!

- I call this one "Moonspiracy"!

Huh, wow.

That's incredible.

What the heck?

Morty, do you realize how

ridiculous that sounds?

Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.

Are you serious?

Half the crap we've seen,

and you think that sounds crazy?

I've been to 300 versions

of Earth's moon,

including this one,

and I've never seen signs

of a "regular dude,"

as you describe him,

hanging out up there.

It's probably just

a smudge on the lens.

Smudge on the lens?

Smudge on the lens?!

I know the difference between

a man threatening me

and a smudge on

the goddamn lens, Summer!

Morty, calm down!

Are you feeling okay?

I'm fine!

So sensitive.

Kids,

I'd like to introduce you all

to our new guidance counselor,

Mr. Lunas.

I look forward

to helping guide you all

towards a brighter future.

I believe every

student should...

shoot for the moon.

Got you now, you son of a bitch.

What's this?

Proof that Mr. Lunas

isn't who he says he is!

He's not a guidance counselor?

I... I assume he's qualified

to be one, who isn't?

But he also lives on the moon.

Okay.

Hmm.

Is that it?

Is he doing anything

to hurt anyone?

Oh, he's up to something.

I think I understand.

"Up to something,"

"lives on the moon."

Okay, I'll talk to him.

What did he say?

Denied the moon stuff,

but that's what pedophiles do,

they deny,

it's their bread and butter.

Pedophile?

You don't think so?

I thought the moon thing

might have been code.

No, he's literally

from the moon!

Well, you saw him react.

Moon or not,

that dude likes 'em young.

Gordon Lunas was a good Marine.

We don't know what drove

him to take his own life,

but we want to remember

the good things.

Like how, from a certain angle,

some people would say

he looked like a smudge.

Oh, my God, what have I done?

What have I done?

Jesus, I made that guy

kill himself!

Only in a literal sense.

Here's one I call

"Morty's Menagerie."

They don't all

have titles, though.

It's not a "Simpsons"

Halloween special,

more like a clip show made

of clips you never saw!

I can't believe we got

put into a menagerie.

So this guy collects

living beings?

Yeah, you know like

commemorative plates,

but less off-putting.

You'll get it when you're still

actively dating in your 40s.

Assess this with

cold indifference,

you beany-headed prick!

Hey, keep it down!

Just our luck, menagerie beneath

the "boulder people"

of Granitor Seven.

I can't take it anymore, Rick!

Relax, Morty!

I can't relax! R-R-Rick, we...

We gotta get outta here!

I don't care what it takes!

Anything!

- Anything?

- Anything!

All right, well, you're gonna

have to take off your shirt.

Not yet.

I'll tell you when.

Dear God.

What?

The signal

turned out to be...

There's no other way

to put it...

Instructions.

For?

A vehicle, sir,

an interstellar vehicle.

We'll need a pilot.

I wonder if there's a volunteer.

Mm.

Oh, the schematics specify

a second, smaller pilot.

I mean, they really

specify smaller.

They have to be exactly 5'3".

Chang, you may have majored

in Liberal Arts,

but I think you're about

to make history.

Primary systems, check.

Auxiliary systems, check.

See you soon.

Okay, now.

Greetings.

You're...

You look...

We've possessed forms

your mind can accept.

Here are some customary

clothing gifts.

Please, put them on.

- May we?

- Of course, yes.

We followed your instructions.

We have so much

to learn from you.

I know, right?

Hey, how come I was able to see

those other people's memories?

I... I wouldn't have been

around for that.

Yeah, sometimes I gotta do

a little editing, Morty.

It helps the mind blowers

play a little bit better

upon revisiting.

I call this one

"The Whole Enchilada."

Here, Morty, this'll make

your urine drinkable.

Now can we keep shopping?

I am Zikzak.

Ah, shit, Morty, get behind me.

It's a [BLEEP] alien overlord!

It's okay.

Here.

Oh, I misjudged.

"I am Floop Floopian.

Please kill me."

That's right, Morty.

The Floop Floopians achieve

an eternal orgasmic afterlife,

so long as they're killed

by a great warrior.

I'm flattered, by the way.

Thank you very much.

So you're gonna kill him?

Eh, let's get some lunch first.

So, you want to get shot

in the head, or...

Well, as long as

the wound is fatal,

I don't really mind

where you shoot me.

Cool.

I'm gonna go take a quick shit.

Well, I gotta say.

You know, I'm a little envious.

Your species has

an actual afterlife.

That's gotta be nice.

Wh-What do you mean?

Well, you know, here on Earth,

w-we don't know what's going on.

It must be nice for you guys to,

you know, have that...

Have that proof's in

the pudding, you know, evidence.

Evidence?

There's supposed to be evidence?

Um, yeah, uh...

otherwise,

how do you know if it's true?

Wait, you don't...

All right, so you want to do

this here or outside?

Run!

I don't wanna die!

Oh, God, it's all real!

Oh, it hurts!

Oh, I shouldn't have doubted it!

I shouldn't have let

you make me doubt it!

Aah!

I blame you, I blame you!

But he said there

wasn't any evidence!

That was a ton of evidence!

Well, silver lining.

Now I know their

religion's real.

They have a hell,

and it does not look good.

I noticed you never finished

your chimichanga,

so I got some room for it now,

if you know what I mean.

Holy [BLEEP]!

How many of these are just

horrible mistakes I've made?

I mean, maybe

I'd stop making so many

if I let myself learn from them!

Don't break your back

creating a lesson, Morty.

It's a freeform anthology.

I'm getting annoyed

you're not hearing that.

As you can see around me,

your mind's been blown

countless times,

and not always by yourself.

Ah, [BLEEP],

I don't even...

This better not

have been a good one.

What is this?

Great, "Booger AIDS,"

"AIDS Booger."

I gotta start using

real file names.

In the meantime,

enjoy a grab bag

of mind blowers I call

"Poop AIDS underscore copy."

I'm not

an unreasonable man, Beth Smith.

I know children are everything

to a mammal.

I will spare one of their lives.

You simply have to choose.

Summer!

Summer.

You're not gonna believe this.

I went to Phoebe

instead of Titan.

It's, like, hello, Saturn,

after ten moons,

time to stop naming and start

numbering, you know?

What's... Wh-What's with you

assholes?

Morty, please, don't do this.

Your Morty is gone!

I am Voltamatron,

Destroyer of Worlds!

Grandpa Rick, there must be some

scientific way to save him!

Not scientific,

but there may be a way.

Morty, I know you're in there.

It's me, your grandpa.

I know I can be mean,

but I love you, Morty.

We all do,

you gotta fight this thing.

I know you can.

You're stronger than all of us!

Morty, it's mom! We love you,

you have to fight it!

Come on, Morty!

Fight that stupid worm thing!

We love you!

We love you so much!

Yes, Morty, come on,

you're doing it!

You're doing it!

You're doing it!

Should we pull it out?

No, don't touch it.

Just keep loving Morty!

We still love you.

But I do have

a thing at 6:00.

Oh, God, do I have

to keep looking?

Geez, Morty, come on,

pinch it off already!

Don't! Oh, God, sorry, Morty,

I love you!

God, is there going

to be an intermission?

Excuse me, but I ordered

the large evil space worm.

I know, it's like,

is that a demon slug

in your stomach,

or are you just happy to...

Sorry!

Well, I guess it's nice to know

the whole family sucks!

So if the blues ones

are my fault,

and the purple ones are my

family's, what are the red ones?

Yeah, d-don't read

into it, Morty!

Ahh.

[BLEEP] We need to find shelter

before the sunset, Morty.

Venzenulon Nine has a night

temperature of 300 below!

We'll freeze, Morty!

W-We'll be dead in seconds!

I... I think I saw

a cave over there.

You've seen

too many movies, Morty.

A cave isn't gonna cut it.

We're gonna have to use Beebo.

Beebo led us to water!

He's our friend!

- He won't even feel it!

- Oh, no, no!

You wanna die, Morty?

Get in Beebo!

Oh, no, no!

Brace for the ice limit.

Here it comes!

Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine

or Venzenulon Seven?

Wait a minute, why would I ask

for that to be removed?

Are the red ones stuff

you wanted removed?

Ooh, that's clever, Morty, but I

don't use color to sort things

because I'm not a mouse in

a European children's book.

Then why are all those

pink ones by the liquor?

Liquor?

[Bleep], that was close.

We lost Captain Sky.

He gave his life

for the uprising.

Yeah. It really makes

you think, huh, Morty?

We should never take

things for granite.

- What?

- I'm just saying, life's short.

We shouldn't take things

for granite.

- Are you saying "granite"?

- Well, yeah.

It's "granted,"

with a "D."

Take things for granted.

Did you actually think it was...

Jesus Christ, Rick,

what are you, a boulder...

A rock person?

How long have you been saying

that wrong?

Oh, you like that, huh?

I b-b-bet that really

blows your mind.

I mean, yeah,

it's kind of great.

- You want me to erase it?

- What, you can do that?

Ah, [BLEEP].

I [BLEEP] knew it,

you piece of [BLEEP]!

You... You...

You're a [BLEEP] asshole, Rick!

Take it easy, Morty, come on.

Just relax.

No, I'm not gonna [BLEEP] relax!

Come here!

Let go of me, you little bitch!

I'm gonna grab you by the

scruff of your... Take that!

Ohh!

- Umm.

- Umm. Uhh.

- What...

- What's going on?

- Where am I?

- Who are we?

Who am I?

I think I'm an adolescent boy.

Huh, and I'm an elderly man.

And we appear to be in some kind

of secret confined space.

Yeah, umm...

Don't look at me like that.

For all we know, you could be

the [BLEEP] weirdo.

Huh, these things are

obviously storage units,

and since we can't remember

what went wrong,

my guess is that the technology

involves memory,

and that this thing on your head

is designed to...

Tell us the code, jagoff!

It's pointless.

He's stonewalling.

Rick, if we don't unlock those

vaccines, Earth dies!

You know, it might be time to

step up your interrogation!

Not sure what

you're implying, Morty,

but some lines I don't cross.

Yeah, well,

I crossed every line I had

when this bastard

tried to kill Jessica!

Okay, see those two fleshy sacs

under his chin, Morty?

Grab 'em.

You remember the codes now?

Twist!

Give us the codes, man!

Twist harder, Morty!

Harder!

Okay, let go, let go,

let him breathe.

He wants to make a deal.

Half the codes now,

half after you finish.

But can we trust...

Wait, what?

F-Finish what?

Y-You know...

I thought I was torturing him!

Oh, and this disappoints you?

Do I tell him we don't

have a deal, Morty?

Because if we can

kill our enemies,

but we can't jack them off, then

how are we better than them?

Well, what did you find out?

We're partners, I guess,

and we fight aliens,

like "Men in Black"?

"Men in Black,"

"Men in Black."

I have "Men in Black 2" in here.

So... So you get

the general idea.

Not quite.

It's basically an endless string

of callbacks to...

All right, save it for Youtube.

I'll keep looking for clues.

What are you doing?

You want your shelf

level or not?

And if I say yes, you're gonna

provide that for me with that?

Yes, see the bubble?

I'm familiar with

the bubble, Morty.

I also dabble in precision,

and if you think

you can even approach it

with your sad, naked,

caveman eyeball

and a bubble of [BLEEP] air,

you're the reason this species

is a failure,

and it makes me angry!

You're drunk.

You want to put up a shelf,

put up a shelf.

You want to experience

true level?

Do you? Y-yes.

Ugh, all right, come on.

Wow, it's so...

Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh,

Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.

Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.

Morty, come on,

we're leaving for school.

Oh, everything's crooked!

Reality is poison!

I want to go back!

I hate this!

What's his deal?

Can't live like this!

Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty,

Morty, Morty.

Go to school, Summer.

I'll go in Morty's memory

and do a little...

Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!

Well?

You seem to be in charge

of what I get to remember.

Why?

Good question.

Morty, I need darkness to prime

these optical inductors.

Hit the leftmost light switch

by the door for me.

The left.

Okay, lights on.

So, did I just hear three

distinct light switch clicks?

W-W-What do you mean?

I feel like the three sounds

I heard could be explained

by an initial erroneous flipping

of a switch on the right

followed by a hasty,

corrective flipping

of the requested switch.

Then during the resultant

darkness and silence, a third,

shameful unflipping of

the initially flipped switch.

Is my assessment accurate?

Yeah, that's... that's basically

how... how it all shaked out.

I'm sorry.

Ugh.

All right, come on.

What?!

Come on!

Grab a shovel.

W-What is...

Grab a shovel!

What was that?

I can't find a goddamn

zip tie anywhere!

All right, [BLEEP] it!

Ahh, zip tie.

Why are you making me

do this for you again?

Who doesn't wish they could

talk to animals, Rick?

Most humans!

There, I'm done,

just stay out of trouble!

Gotta keep moving.

Can't stop.

Up, down, down, up, up, up,

down, up, stop, down.

The queen needs food.

The babies need food.

The queen makes babies.

The situation in Argentina

has proven less convenient

than predicted.

We'll have to re-destabilize

their economy,

refocus labor class outrage

from upper to middle,

foster a coup, and install

a compliant regime.

Same as Guatemala?

Yes, but you can double time it.

We need a quorum

to pick a new pope,

in case the Exxon/Monsanto thing

falls through in Africa.

Why not use chemtrails?

Put a canopy on Uganda.

They're set to agitate

any mo... What?

That kid is watching us.

So, we're squirrels, he's a kid.

He's watching us like he hears

what we're saying.

Hey, kid. Young man?

Come here, little boy.

Tell Daphne to run a 199

on a possible Dolittle.

Little boy!

We'll give you wishes

if you can hear us!

We can make you fly

and get candy.

Oh, [BLEEP]! Oh, [BLEEP]!

[Bleep] me! [Bleep] me!

Rick!

Ah, [BLEEP], Morty,

what did you do?

All right, Morty,

pack your shit!

That's only gonna keep 'em down

for a little bit, Morty!

You [BLEEP] with

squirrels, Morty!

We got a good five minutes

before they're backing up

on our ass, Morty!

We have to pack up and move

to a new reality, Morty!

You know I said we could

only do that a couple of times!

We're [BLEEP] over here because

of these damn squirrels, Morty!

I don't know what

my reaction is,

but I think I'm mounting

in suspicion of you.

- Well, what are you gonna do?

- I'm gonna remember everything!

Everything!

Yeah!

Ow!

Ah!

Ow!

Well, what'd you find out?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what

are you gonna do, kill me?

No, I'm not gonna kill you.

I'm gonna kill myself!

All those memories just erased!

Sitting in this room

collecting dust!

W-What's the point of going on

if most of everything

that happens just ends up

sitting in here?

All right, kid.

I don't know much aside from

the fact that "Men in Black 2"

is a joyless cash grab, but I do

know that whatever you have

brewing around in your noggin

really connected with you.

I can't deny that,

and I can't deny that I'm

inspired by your passion.

I want in.

Suicide pact!

Yes, yeah, let's do it!

Together, you old son

of a bitch! On three!

One...

Two...

You guys doing

Morty's Mind Blowers?

Morty's Mind Blowers?

Grandpa,

is this scenario three?

Uh, w-what's that,

and w-who are you?

Oh, man, it's a scenario four.

Ugh, [BLEEP] goddamn it!

I don't get paid enough

for this shit!

<i>There's a Craftsman nearby.

I can smell it.</i>

Whoa, what... what...

<i>Can I help you?</i>

H-How did we fall asleep during

interdimensional cable?

- Yeah, what the hell, Summer?

- Summer, you dumb bitch!

How long were we out,

you dumb bitch!

How much interdimensional cable

did we miss, you stupid bitch!

How many improv TV shows with

commercials did we miss, Summer?

Why did you let us fall asleep?

You dumb bitch! You stupid bitch!

All right, Morty,

[BLEEP] this noise.

Let's get out of here

and go on a classic

Rick and Morty adventure.

Yeah, right, Rick, I'm allin.

No wonder you're

constantly fighting

with each other

and behind schedule.

What?

Nothing.

Rick?

Hello?

Just here for my putter.

Jerry's Mind Blowers?

Follow the boys!

We're charged and aimed

at Alpha Centauri,

ready for transport.

They fell for it!

Let's send Gobo home!

All right!

- Where's dad?

- He should be here any second.

It's funny, Jerry spent his life

seeking attention,

but in the end, humanity's

instinctive dismissal of him

saved an alien's life.

He knows where to go, right?

Yep, any minute now.

Did it work?

Did you guys get Gobo home?

You have Gobo! You were supposed

to bring him to the hill!

As if.

He was in your basket.

He was in your car!

Oh!

Oof!

Dibs on his stuff.

Did yoof that?

Wow. He's really getting

executed after all this time.

You know the son that he ate was...

Your best friend...

Tommy.

We know.

Stop true-crime bragging.

I was traumatized, Summer.

Okay, your generation wouldn't get that.

Bitch, my generation

gets traumatized for breakfast.

It took years of therapy

to even process the reality.

I mean, when I was a kid,

I just told myself

that Tommy had gotten lost

in the magical realm of Froopyland.

"Froopyland?"

My make-believe world.

I know the name's stupid,

but it was so real to me.

Aren't you guys supposed

to be at your father's

for custody weekend?

We're not in a hurry.

Dad sleeps until sundown.

Can we talk a little bit more

about this Froopy...

Not the bubble gun!

There's no air...

I gotta say, I am warming up

to the bubble gun.

You know, if you're so great

at naming things,

why don't you do it from now on?

- What?

- Froopyland.

Was it my best work?

I don't know.

Does it deserve

to be shit on creatively?

Yeah, that's right.

I agree with your look

of horrified realization.

You can be very inconsiderate sometimes.

Here it is.

You know, I collapsed

a quantum tesseract to...

Dad, I don't care how you made it.

I want to know if Tommy's

still in there!

Relax, Beth.

If he is, we'll find him.

He'll be the only

sun-bleached skeleton

with non-imaginary DNA.

Tommy!

This is a nightmare.

I can't believe you used to lock me up

in this glorified chicken coop.

Chicken coop?

Those are procedurally

generated clouds, Beth.

That river is a rainbow.

Literally.

Come on, I-I-I put real

elbow grease into this place.

Well, you're supposed to put

elbow grease into your daughter!

Gross.

Do you think something ate him?

Nope.

Froopyland creatures

were designed to be harmless.

He definitely just starved to death.

I could have been the one

who starved to death in here.

What if I'd gotten hurt?

God, you're right.

I'm a terrible dad.

Well, nothing to live for.

Goodbye, cruel world!

Dad!

Oh, how do you like that?

What kind of merciless creator

makes the ground bouncy?

I'm gonna have to drown myself.

Unh!

Oh, no.

Oh, the water's breathable?

Who went and did that?

Oh, whatever.

Yeah, whatever.

A dad makes a toilet

look like R2-D2,

and it breaks the front page of Reddit,

but I'm Charles Manson

because I gave you

your own world instead of an iPad.

I think the words you're

looking for are... Aah!

Holy [bleep]

[bleep] This thing has claws!

Yeah, I get it.

It's a childproof world.

No, no, seriously,

this hurts really bad!

This thing is sinking

razor-sharp claws in...

Aah!

[bleep]

You've made your point, Dad.

Dad?

Ugh!

Whose idea was this stupid

custody weekend thing?

I think it's supposed to help

prevent abandonment issues.

I want to be abandoned.

Yeah, I'm talking about Dad.

Bienvenue a la Chez Divorced Dad.

Wow, Dad.

Your place looks way less

like a crackhouse.

It's actually clean,

like a cocaine house.

Dad, what's going on?

I'm simply centered, activated...

And telekinetic?

Pretty cool, huh?

Check it out.

Who wants a smoothie?

Oh... Oh, no.

Uh, oh, God.

Summer... Summer,

can you...

- Aah!

- Sorry.

You have much to learn, my Uloo.

Morty, Summer, this is Kiara.

She's a Krootabulan warrior priestess

from Krootabulon.

I-I know where Krootabulans

are from, Dad.

Uh, Chaimuntolo.

Chaimuntolo, younglings.

Hymen... cholo.

Your father's mind holds love for you.

I am humbled to meet in physicality.

Dad, are you...

In love with a badass, sexy alien lady?

Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer.

You tell me.

I wasn't going to ask

if you were in love

since you barely know her.

Summer.

Kiara and I met on that

interstellar dating service

Rick was always suggesting

when your mom and I were together.

And things just kind of clicked.

We must move!

Our reservation

is at 7:00.

I hate to see her leave,

but I love to watch

her phase shift away.

I'm sure you noticed

what she has three of,

but guess what she has two of?

Oof!

All right, knock it off!

Listen, I've been giving you a pass

because I'm charmed

that life finds a way, but...

Aah!

All right, you know what?

Ouch!

Oh!

Unh!

Ouch!

God!

Aah!

Agh!

Oh, Dad, this place is the safest.

Best dad ever.

Can't you just say,

"I admit it, I screwed up"?

Uh, what would be the point of that?

You can't do it, can you?

You can't just [bleep] apologize.

Okay, okay, Beth, I'm sorry...

you think you deserve an apology.

Hey, don't look at me.

You let your kid roll around

on the floor of a target,

it's gonna get stepped on.

Huh. Well, here's the problem

right here.

We've got a bunch of

Froopyland procedural carbons

all gummed up and mixed in

with real human DNA.

Are you saying Tommy survived here

by having sex with Froopy creatures,

creating Froopy-human

hybrid offspring,

and then consuming their proteins,

sustaining himself with an endless

cycle of cannibalistic incest?

It's just a working theory.

Of course, if that's the case,

I expect he'd be worshiped

as a kind of god

by a medieval-level

society

of his least-delicious

children.

Halt!

You are now prisoners

of our exalted ruler,

giver and taker of life,

helper and consumer of mortality,

dispenser of life...

Yes, if I could interrupt?

We're way ahead of the reveal here.

Yeah, just take us to King Tommy.

I thought warrior priestesses

could only leave Krootabulon on a hunt.

Mmm.

Thank you, sweetie.

I hope it's not human season.

I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix.

I would never hunt a human.

Your father and I

are soul-bonded.

Soul-bonded?

Um, does your planet have shorter days,

because you guys are moving

kind of fast, no?

Go get him, honey!

She's always hunting.

She probably knew a Varrix worked here,

and that's why she said

the Yelp reviews didn't matter.

Dad, do you understand

how serious

Krootabulon soul-bonding is?

Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know.

It's got such a casual name.

If you want to lecture anyone

about commitment,

start with your mom.

Oh, my God.

Dad, is that what this is about?

Are you rushing into a new thing

to get back at Mom?

Every weekend, you two

have told me to move on.

Move on, like, out of bed.

Like, stop using paper towels

for toilet paper,

not move on into a sloppy rebound.

Dad, you need to slow down,

rethink this soul bond.

Why don't you just say

what you really mean?

You think it's cool

that having sex with her

gives me telekinesis

and you recognize she's got a hot bod

like Cheetara in "Thundercats,"

but you're grossed out

by her avocado-shaped head

and blue skin,

and you think I want to put

a bag and a wig on her head.

After all the time and energy I spent

teaching you two about race...

you ended up racist.

Soon your world will be rid of Varrix.

Tomorrow, we celebrate.

We could take the kids

to the water park.

We celebrate with a hunt!

Ooh.

You kids want to hunt?

- Yes.

- Yes.

All kneel for King Tommy!

I'm not kneeling.

Suck my [bleep]

Well, hello, all!

I am the King of Froopyland,

but I go by another name, too.

We know.

It's Tommy!

- We know.

- We know.

I have lived here

since I was a mere child.

- We know.

- Got it.

I suppose you're wondering,

how do I sustain myself?

- Oh, boy.

- No, we aren't.

I always find the theater

is the best way to clarify things.

- Ugh.

- Seriously?

Oh, my God.

Players, go!

I am little Tommy.

I am tiny Beth.

Oh, come on.

Come with me to a magic land.

Don't do it!

This is my secret Froopyland

where I have no rules!

I am excited.

I am jealous of Tommy's friends

and his Nintendo

and his dad who likes him.

I take it Tommy wasn't class playwright.

You want to see the Honey Swamp?

Yes!

Let's do it!

Well, I want to see you dead.

Ow, help!

I'm stuck!

I'm covered in honey.

Huh.

Well, that's interesting.

Fake news.

Many nights have passed,

trapped in this strange land.

I am hungry, and all I can do

to pass the time is hump.

I will hump this rock.

I will hump this tree.

I will hump this beast of the land

and put my seed in it.

I am the first of Tommy's children.

Eat of my flesh so you may survive.

And so I did.

Oh, wow.

Okay.

Yeah.

Certified fresh.

Good... Good job.

Perhaps a demonstration is in order.

- No, that is the last thing that is in order!

- Ugh.

Oh, my God.

Poor Froopy character.

Leave him alone.

Ahh.

Gather round, gang!

Dinner time.

All right, that's it.

I'm outta here.

What are you doing?

We're in the middle of an adventure.

Here's some things

an adventure needs, Beth.

Conflict, stakes,

a way for me to benefit,

and, clearly, Morty.

But Tommy's still in there,

raping Muppets and eating babies.

Yep. Luckily,

that's not our problem.

Time to pull the plug.

Pull the plug?

We have to get Tommy out of there, okay?

We... We need to do

the right thing.

Do what you never did as a dad...

Put in a little effort.

All right,

cut the high-road routine.

We both saw Tommy's shitty play.

You pushed him in the Honey Swamp, Beth.

His very happy life is in your hands.

You go save him from it.

You're gonna believe

a play over your own daughter?

Yes, I am, Beth,

because you're not my own daughter.

Oh, God, yes.

I'm one of infinite Beths

with infinite fathers

in infinite universes.

It's called a hug, Dad.

It won't kill you.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

You know why all Ricks made a Froopyland

for all their little girls?

Same reason I wasn't surprised

by Tommy's overwritten,

badly structured,

cheaply produced flashback.

You were a scary [bleep] kid, man.

Oh, my God.

I didn't make Froopyland

to get rid of you, Beth.

I did it to protect the neighborhood.

Not in a noble sense.

It was just more practical

to sequester you

before I had to start,

you know, cloning a replacement

for every less-than-polite

little boy or gullible animal

that might cross

your socio-path.

You would rather believe I'm evil

than admit that you were a bad father?

Oh, dude, no.

No, bad father all the way

to the max over here.

I'm a [bleep] nutcase.

And the acorn plopped

straight down, baby.

Look at some of this shit

you were asking me to make you as a kid.

Ray guns.

A whip that forces people to like you.

Invisibility cuffs,

a parent trap, a lightning gun,

a teddy bear with

anatomically correct innards,

night-vision googly-eye glasses,

sound-erasing sneakers,

false fingerprints,

fall-asleep darts,

a lie-detecting doll,

an indestructible baseball bat,

a Taser shaped like a ladybug,

a fake police badge,

location-tracking stickers,

rainbow-colored duct tape,

mind-control hair clips,

poison gum,

a pink, sentient switchblade.

Hi, Beth, you've gotten taller.

Shall we resume stabbing?

Has it occurred to you

that I asked you to make those things

because I wanted you

to spend time with me?

Has it occurred to you that

<i>if</i> I did try killing Tommy,

it might be because

I was jealous of his family?

Wait, what?

Why?

Wasn't his dad, like,

some kind of cannibal?

Seems like it must be hereditary.

Oh, my God.

This is your fault.

I am not a bad person.

I'm gonna go back in there,

I'm getting Tommy, and I'm fixing this!

Whatever you say,

Stone Cold Steve Austin.

I don't know why I just said that.

Doesn't make a lot of sense,

but gotta stand by it.

Whatever you say,

Stone Cold Steve Austin.

I'm owning it.

No, Dad!

You're not doing it right!

Cutting off their heads

isn't doing it right?

They're clearly regenerative!

I-I think you have to stab them

through the heart or something.

You think or you know?

I thought you were the alien

expert, Isaac Asi-hole.

Don't snap at me!

I'm tired!

- Me, too!

- We're all tired!

That's the last of them.

Tonight, we celebrate.

With a hunt?

Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt.

I, uh, really have to get out

of this soul bond.

- What the [bleep] Dad?

- Oh, my God! Duh!

- Obviously!

- Yeah, no kidding!

Can you guys help me?

What? How?

Can I just, uh, tell her

it's because of my kids?

You know, like, you don't like

the shape of her head, or...

That's you, Dad!

That's<i> you!</i>

You're a baby and an idiot!

I think that's been established,

Summer. Now help me!

First, I want you to admit

that you're a closet racist,

a beta-male sexist,

and you dragged everyone

into a horrible situation

by only thinking of yourself.

Okay.

I want to hear you say it.

Look, I'm a closeted racist,

and I'm sexist and selfish,

and I dragged us all into

my sexist, racist bad things

because I'm stupid.

Thank you.

Now you're gonna help me, right?

She just did.

Yeah, clean up your own mess.

Wait, wait, what?

Oh, man.

All right, everybody.

Next item on the docket...

I would like to have sex

with some of you,

and then eat the babies.

I thought you'd like that.

I do keep rolling out the hits, don't I?

Oh!

It's the Magic Crayon Lady!

Are you hungry?

I was just about to make dinner.

And by "make dinner," I mean...

Tommy, I'm going to take you

to the real world.

Well, this<i> is</i> the real world.

No, you don't understand!

Your dad...

Uh, people think your dad ate you!

So?

You doy-oy!

People should eat people.

Just leave me alone!

Tommy, you don't understand.

I have to make this right

because it's my fault

that you're in here.

I'm Beth.

- Beth?

- The destroyer!

The destroyer!

Oh, suck it up, Princess Incest.

You fell into some honey.

Well, it tends to happen

when one is pushed into honey.

I respect your right

to believe I pushed you.

Oh, do I get to have that?

Is my reality like

a little side of fries...

a little Kwanzaa

you're willing to slide my way?

Yes, because I'm focused

on saving your father's life

because I'm not a petty piece of [bleep]

So, then, it should be pretty easy

to say,

"Sorry I pushed you."

Real easy and not necessary,

since you coming home

will save your dad's life

whereas nothing is changed

by anyone stroking

your batshit-crazy ego.

Sorry, forgive me.

Uh, I've been in Froopyland

for quite a while.

Have apologies changed?

Tommy, I'm sorry you think

you deserve an apology.

Oh, my God.

I'm my father.

Uh, will someone

just kill this B-word?

Hi-ya!

Oh, my God.

I'm my father!

Ya!

Ooh! Froopy!

It's stab time!

Ooh!

And that's why one pussy

plus two pussies

makes a bunch of pussies.

Come on, y'all, I'm trying to make this

appealing to your

sex-addicted lifestyles.

Hi, I need to pull Morty out of

school. Come on, Morty.

Ha! You heard

your daddy, Morty.

you have to leave school.

Wait, what are my values?

Dad, what's going on?

We're going to Alaska.

What? Why?

It's nice there.

Also, I broke up with Kiara,

and she didn't take it well,

and she wants to murder you two.

What? Th-Then why

are we walking?

I'm walking because I'm tired.

You guys should definitely run.

Excuse me, I just...

You know what?

I'm... I'm just gonna go left.

No, okay, your left, that's fine.

Do you know what left is,

'cause... Ugh!

What does your breakup

have to do with us?

Yeah, we chose Mom hands down.

I thought we made that clear

at the lawyer's office

and in the comments under

your weird rant on Facebook.

She kind of blames you guys

for the breakup.

- Why?

- Why?

Because I told her it was your fault.

- What?!

- What?!

Look, I'm not an evil person.

I'm just not very imaginative!

Cool.

Dad?

I feel like I've spent my life

pretending you're a great guy

and trying to be like you.

And the ugly truth has always been...

That I'm not that great a guy

and you're exactly like me.

Am I evil?

Worse.

You're smart.

When you know nothing matters,

the universe is yours.

And I've never met a universe

that was into it.

The universe is basically an animal.

It grazes on the ordinary.

It creates infinite idiots

just to eat them,

not unlike your friend Timmy.

Tommy.

Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie.

You know, smart people get

a chance to climb on top,

take reality for a ride,

but it'll never stop

trying to throw you.

And, eventually, it will.

There's no other way off.

Dad, I'm out of excuses

to not be who I am.

So who am I?

What do I do?

My advice...

Take off.

Put a saddle on your universe.

Let it kick itself out.

I can't do that.

The kids, Jerry, my job,

and, as much as I hate to admit

it, ABC's "The Bachelor."

I can make a clone of you,

a perfect instance of you,

with all your memories.

An exact copy in every way.

It'll love and provide for the kids,

do your job, and consume

broadcast-network reality TV

on the same allegedly ironic

level as you.

You could be gone a day, a week,

or the rest of your life

with zero consequences.

The moment you decide to come back,

I flip a switch,

and the clone's job is done.

It feels no pain, it regrets nothing,

and has zero chance

of going "Blade Runner."

If nothing matters,

why would you do that for me?

I don't know, maybe you matter

so little that I like you.

Or maybe it makes you matter.

Maybe I love you.

Maybe something about your mother.

Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth.

I don't know if I can do it.

Then stay, and luxuriate in a life

you can finally know you've chosen.

My secret bonus is that

no matter what you choose,

you're finally gonna

chill the [bleep] out.

Okay.

I know what I want to do.

Aah!

Ow!

You can't run forever!

She's really pissed off.

I know.

It's kinda hot.

Shut up!

The hunters!

They're back! Run!

- We're not hunters.

- We want to hide with you.

We're not hiding.

We're nesting.

Ooh la la.

The children must be destroyed

so that we can be together.

You need to break up with her,

Dad... properly!

God damn it, Dad!

Dump her!

Okay, okay.

Kiara, let's just run away.

- Dad!

- Come on!

Just rip

the Band-Aid off!

Okay!

Kiara, when I told you

my kids were bigoted racists

who were demanding I break up with you,

I lied.

If anybody deserves to be

telekinetically strangled,

it's me.

<i>I'm</i> the one who wants to break up.

I... I'm not

an evil person.

I'm lazy, I'm cowardly,

and... and I do not

know what I'm doing.

Look, I got someone pregnant at 17.

We're getting a divorce.

None of this is on purpose.

I was excited to date someone cool

because it would make my ex notice me.

I would expect nothing less

from humanity...

a selfish, manipulative,

dishonest species that...

- Kiara?

- Trandor!

What are you doing here?

Just... hunting.

Do you really expect me to believe

it has nothing to do with us?

You knew Earth was my domain.

I don't like what you're insinuating.

Dad, can we go now?

Hold on a second.

I'm starting to get the feeling

that<i> I</i> was the rebound.

Dad, you just got handed an Ex Machina.

You're taking it.

Varrix nests spread across 300 galaxies,

and you just happened to pick

this planet to hunt?

That's Gorgon shit...

total Gorgon shit!

We're home!

Hey, guys!

What's for dinner?

How was Jerry's?

The usual.

Can we have pizza?

Pizza sounds great.

Hey, Rick, did you know my dad

was dating an alien?

No. Gross.

For the alien.

Aw, crap, I think Arnaldo's is closed.

Are you guys sure you want pizza?

Arnaldo's isn't closed in the dimension

where they didn't invent

Daylight Savings!

What would we do without you?

I love you, Dad.

Love you, too, sweetie.

By the way, that wasn't time travel.

There were just a couple pizzas

on the counter.

I grabbed them.

Come on, football!

Go, go!

Oh, come on.

Play football!

Aaah!

So, you're mining stuff

to craft with

and crafting stuff to mine with?

Uh-huh.

Did your dad write this game?

Mean.

Gentlemen, you're needed

by a friend in Washington!

How clandestine.

If they can teleport,

why did we take...

I just work here, Steve,

same as you!

All right.

All right, all right.

Mr. President.

It's about time, gentlemen.

Rick, do you need to drink in here?

Yes.

Here's the adventure.

Some kind of alien... googa

has infested

the Kennedy Sex Tunnels.

I want it hunted down

and taken out.

Kennedy Sex Tunnels?

Naturally, you'll forget

you saw them,

along with, in order of

national embarrassment,

the Truman Cocaine Lounge,

the McKinley Hooker Dump,

and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum.

He didn't free them all.

And let me know when you're done.

Maybe then we could get a selfie?

Too busy, Morty.

Now tell me about this summit.

Is it a peace one or a regular one?

Ugh. This sucks.

God, tell me about it.

Oh, man.

If you're not into it...

What do you mean?

Why would I be into it?

It's lame.

You're into lame stuff, Morty.

I thought young dumb people

considered it an honor

to work for presidents

or whatever the shit.

Maybe the first few times,

but this just sucks.

He treats us like Ghostbusters.

We should talk to him.

Yeah, that sounds fun.

Let's set some boundaries

with a spoiled control freak

that thinks he runs the world

and orders drone strikes

to cope with his insecurity.

It's either that or more of this.

Third choice...

"Minecraft."

You like it now?

Got to be honest, Morty.

It's growing on me.

Notify the president.

What do I tell him?

Tell him the truth.

Tell him Rick and Morty

just blew off America.

♪

You can use that wood

to make a chest.

Oh, good. Then I can

store all this wood

I'll need later

for chest-making.

Okay. You're not

going to have fun

if you analyze everything.

This is what they'd rather do?

It's all in the transcript.

"Treats us like Ghostbusters."

So, Ghostbusters aren't cool now?

I don't recall signing that bill.

"Control freak."

"Orders drone strikes

to cope with..."

"Insecurity."

Should we drone-strike

them?

That would prove them right!

And blow him up.

Give me the phone.

Is this game popular

with autistic people?

Why would you say

something like that?

'Cause I'm starting to love it.

"Failure to answer

is a felony offense"?

Play it cool. As far as he knows,

we're still in the tunnels.

When should we reveal

we can see them?

We're holding all

the cards right now.

We don't show any before

the time is right.

- Awesome.

- Yello?

Hi, guys.

U.S. President calling.

How's it going?

Oh, hey.

Just hard at work

on this sex tunnel gagoo.

I think it's kind of our

new archnemesis, you know?

It might take a while.

What do you think,

Morty... a month?

Fingers crossed, a month, yeah.

You lying dicks!

I see your asses playing

"Minecraft"!

I got you on satellite!

That's right.

What do you have to say

for yourselves?

Okay, obviously, this looks

bad, Mr. President.

I mean, what doesn't look bad

through an illegal spy satellite?

Don't high-road me.

The two of you break

1,000 federal laws a day.

Wow, really?

That's pretty cool.

And, yes, yes, yes, yes,

you save the world now and then.

America returns that favor

by not holding the two of you

accountable to its laws.

Oh!

Oh! Oh, God.

We... We didn't know

you saw it that way.

Well, it's nobody's fault.

We never had "the talk,"

so to speak.

Yeah. I mean,

the way we see it,

when we show up,

that's the favor to you.

Especially, you know,

when it turns out

you wanted someone to come over

just because you found

an "X-Files" monster

in your basement.

As for the reason you've never,

like, arrested us,

we assumed you just knew

that it was impossible,

like, if you tried.

You know, it wouldn't go well.

Wouldn't go well?

Can you elaborate?

I think one of your 1,000 laws

says, no, I can't elaborate.

Just trust me.

None of us want to go there.

Which we'll never have to.

By the way, we'll keep on

saving the Earth.

You know, we're...

We're happy to do that.

Yeah, but not because

it contains America...

Because moving to a new version

of Earth is a bitch and a half.

But feel free to call us, you

know, as... as, like, friends.

Yeah, like, if you ever

want to take a selfie...

So, are we cool?

Yes.

Thank you, gentlemen.

I told you, man!

I'm impressed, Morty.

That went really well.

Everybody, get ahold of yourselves!

Sir, what is our new

Rick and Morty policy?

Our policy is, we never needed

them and never will again.

Today, we celebrate

our independence

from Rick and Morty.

Everyone out.

<i>All this spring at Clothes

Mart, there's a clothes sale.</i>

<i>Come on down

to the clothes section.</i>

I just put it on for fun.

I know I can't buy it.

Oh, come on. You look great!

You're only young once.

Just promise, if the results

are too strong,

you'll use protection.

Really?! Thanks!

When did you get rad?

I don't know.

Maybe I adjusted to the divorce

and everything's new.

I'll say. I couldn't stand you

for more than an hour

at a time before.

No... No offense.

I like it. It's great.

You're like a different person.

Yeah.

Different person.

Oh, not you.

Vamos! Vamos!

Aaah!

How do you like that, Morty?

Whoa!

Just like "Minecraft"!

Ooh, a tiny

nuclear-capable species

just got discovered in the Amazon.

Let's go make first contact

before someone else

gets all their shit.

What about this?

South Park did it

4 years ago, Morty.

They're fast.

Or we're slow.

Don't do it, guys.

The casualties would be

in the "Brazilians"

because you're Brazilian.

It's a threat and a pun.

Nobody gets me.

Americanos! Pressa!

Oh. Hello, Rick.

You're here, too.

I guess this is a global crisis.

Oh, God.

Mr. President, Morty and I

have the situation covered.

I'm sure you did.

Dismissed.

Dismissed?

Yeah, dismissed.

Not needed here. You can leave

and nobody will care.

Have you never heard that before? Do you

even know how to take out this kind of threat?

We're not taking it out.

We're going to shrink down and

approach them diplomatically.

You shrink with pills?

Are you still here?

Shouldn't you be going down

to your next version of Earth

with your selfie-craving

star-[bleep] sidekick?

Whoa!

We're allowed to be here.

You aren't president of the Amazon.

Yeah, I learned about

your job in school.

You're a civil servant.

We're technically your boss.

Oh, please, Morty.

You pay as many taxes

as you have pubes.

Oh, I got pubes,

Commander-in-Queef.

You want to count them?

Commander-in-Queef.

That's it! Do it!

Recognize the rare element

Sanchez-eum?

We've been preparing for a Rick-level

eventuality for some time.

You mean you've been ordering

other people to prepare for it

while you sat on your ass

at peace summits.

Peace summits are important!

Oh, yeah!

They work great!

We're really drowning in peace!

You suck!

You suck!

Task Force Alpha,

prepare to shrink.

Is there a Task Force Alpha

health plan, by the way?

Because if those pills are based

on subatomic compression,

you could get a more curable cancer

just walking through

the mushroom clouds.

God damn it!

I'll do it.

Whoa.

Task Force Alpha is disbanded.

And you two aren't

American anymore!

I can say that.

You're expatriated!

If you step foot

on homeland soil again,

I'll treat it as an invasion.

Is this supposed to be painful?

Painful to watch.

Oh, such lame shrinking.

Oh, his clothes stay the same size?

'70s shrinking, party of one.

Eat my shrinking ass!

There he goes. All right.

Let's get out of here, Morty.

What the hell?!

I made Sanchez-eum up,

dumbasses.

Don't believe everything

you read on Wikipedia.

Stand down.

He's not afraid of pirates.

Oh! Run, Morty!

That part was true!

I-I can't talk now, sweetie.

Oh, when can you?

- Good point.

- What's up?

Remember a little while ago

when you said that, if I wanted,

I could, like, leave Earth

and wander the infinite cosmos

to figure out who I am and that

nobody would ever know I'd left

because you could

replace me with a clone?

Mm-hmm.

Am I the clone?

Sorry. What?

Am I the clone?

Did the real me choose to leave,

and I only think I chose to stay

because that's what I need to think

because I'm the replacement Beth?

No.

Okay.

And one more thing. If I were

a clone, would you tell me?

Beth, you know, when...

When smart people get happy,

they stop recognizing themselves.

And you are very smart because

you're very much my daughter.

Oh, God. You're right.

I'm sorry.

Thank you, Dad.

All good?

Totally.

I'm fine now.

And just to be sure, you're not

pretending to be convinced you're real

because you're actually

convinced you're a clone

and you're now terrified

that becoming self-aware

would mean I'd have

to terminate you?

No.

Okay. Glad I could help.

See you soon.

Aaaaaah!

Where do I go?

What does th... What... What...

What... What does this mean?

This means nothing.

Pull forward and park.

Then say that, God damn it!

Sorry.

Bad day.

I am Presidentress of

the Mega Gargantuans.

We named ourselves

before learning we were small.

Madam Presidentress,

I'm President of America,

which is basically the world,

but you didn't hear that from me.

I've come to...

I know who you are.

We've already agreed to a ceasefire

with your ambassadors,

Rick and Morty.

Rick and Morty were here?

Of course they were here.

They can shrink

instantly and teleport.

They told me to give you this.

They said it will stretch

as your cancer pill wears off

and your body awkwardly enlarges

at the rate of a '50s movie.

Are there pants?

They said you'd prefer

just a shirt.

Apparently, you have a need

to swing your dick around?

Rick and Morty escaped.

No shit.

Take me to the Pentagon.

We're at war with Rick and Morty.

You'll want to make a stop

at the White House?

I have pants at the Pentagon,

Rhonda. It's in my contract.

I mean you need to call

a press conference.

Israel and Palestine have

announced a permanent ceasefire.

What?

They signed something called.

"The Pretty Obvious If You

Think About It" accord.

Apparently, an anonymous

American diplomat

took them to a "Star Wars" cantina,

where they smoked

perspective-enhancing

alien pheromones

through a laser hookah.

I still say it has to be Putin.

It was Rick and Morty,

you [bleep] dunce!

But you're getting the credit, sir.

Your approval rating just hit 1.

Why would Rick and Morty want that?

Because they're assholes!

I'm flattered, but it takes a whole

team to achieve what we did today.

Thank you.

Well? They haven't

been back home, sir.

We've got every possible

location under surveillance.

God damn it!

They're right here!

They're here, God damn it!

Code Red! We need backup!

Everybody relax.

Just waiting for you

in the only room

you can't blow up or spy on.

So, we're not changing

timelines for you,

but now you have

everything you want,

so you can forget we exist,

and we'll return the favor.

You couldn't say that in a text?

Well, since we won't be seeing

each other again, my...

Guys, we get it.

It's a Code Red. Enough.

My grandson has

worked hard for you,

and I feel like

he's earned a selfie.

Honestly, I could take it or leave

it at this point. You're taking it.

No. What kind of fratty-ass

status move is that?

Get out of my office!

Seriously?

You're that stubborn?

He's the stubborn one.

I'm protecting my country.

Uh, from selfies?

From subordination

to hostile powers.

Uh, does China know about

that deal-breaker?

China doesn't piss

on the White House.

Well, why would they?

I'm sure it was expensive.

Get out.

Not without a selfie.

Arrest them. Son, you have a

right to refuse his order,

and I guarantee you're going

to die if you touch me,

and there's no afterlife.

Everything just goes black.

Don't do it.

Whoa, Rick!

Okay.

What was that?

Death.

What kind?

Instant.

There was no sound.

He just died.

Yeah, terrifying.

It's a terrifying thing

to watch happen.

It's called a deterrent.

You couldn't just knock him out?

How is knocking out a deterrent?

Everyone wants to be knocked out.

Nobody wants to be dead.

You committed murder

in the Oval Office.

Now you can't leave.

That's fine.

I said I'm not leaving

without a selfie.

Uh, I don't need a selfie.

And I'm saying

you aren't getting one

and you aren't leaving.

So we agree?

Yes. No. We disagree

because you think you're getting

a selfie and leaving.

Am I getting a selfie?

Never.

Then I'm never leaving.

Exactly.

See?

Does anyone have a shot?

Yes, nine people.

I can show you.

But I wouldn't recommend...

Open fire!

God, you are dumb!

Get the President out of here!

Bad idea.

Wait. Why?

Because if there isn't

someone in here

that they're not supposed to kill,

they're going to wreck

the place trying to kill me.

As long as you live,

no matter where you are,

if it isn't in a selfie with him,

I'll be here.

Jesus!

He's not a [bleep] god!

You don't know what I am!

And you don't know what I can do!

Jesus!

It's... It's cool, Rick!

I'm Doctor Who in this [bleep]

I could be a clone.

I could be a hologram.

We could be clones

controlled by robots

controlled with special headsets

that the real Rick and Morty

are wearing

while they're [bleep] your mother!

I'm going to kill you!

Then come to 312 Olive Street!

Is that her address?

You don't know because

you're a bad son!

Ow!

Take him down!

Semper fi!

Aaaaah!

<i>Number three, The Twister.</i>

Ow! Damn it.

<i>Number four...</i>

<i>The Hanky Panky.</i>

Beth?

My dad might have cloned me,

and I might be the clone.

And he says I'm not, but that's

what he'd say to a clone.

Typical.

<i>Number six, The Texas Ripple.</i>

You look like you to me.

What are you, an idiot?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

That was so rude.

I came to you for help, and now

I'm insulting your intelligence.

And look where

intelligence gets you.

Well, don't knock intelligence,

because right now

I'd love to understand

how I can help you.

I can't be in charge

of that, Jerry.

My mind, my ideas are all

part of the variable.

The only constant is you.

You know me inside and out.

Do what you have to do.

Okay. Sit down.

Now cross your legs.

That leg on top. Good.

Oh, what is this?

Senior year, I took you on a date

to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra

performing the music

of Alan Silvestri in the Park.

At this point in the song

from "Volcano,"

when Tommy Lee Jones

and the utility workers

are using cars to guide

the lava into a cul-de-sac,

I realized my palms were so sweaty,

I would never get

to hold your hand.

But I was desperate to touch you,

so I wiped my palm

on the grass next to me.

But a Snickers wrapper

kind of got stuck on it,

so I started kind of jiggling it,

whipping it without

moving too much.

But you started looking over,

and I thought,

"Well, this is it. She's going

to see that I'm a loser,"

and I'll never get to touch her.

"But I still have time

to touch her."

But my hand had Snickers on it,

and the brass section was swelling

because it was the scene with

the guy melting in the lava.

And I just thought, "[Bleep] it.

Lips don't sweat."

Wow. Yeah.

I'll never forget that feeling.

You're the real thing.

Then that settles it,

because my memory

is of hating that night.

But now, reliving it,

all I can feel is how lucky I am

to be loved by such a simple,

honest, simple man.

Simple twice.

This isn't the woman

you married, Jerry,

because this woman loves you.

Uh... well,

vive la différence.

Okay. That was lame.

Listen, I... Words.

Don Cheadle.

You have the right to get

the [bleep] out of my office!

You have the right to kiss my dick!

Give me the thing.

Ugh!

Oh!

Ugh!

Oh!

Ugh! Ugh!

Ohh!

Submit!

Submit for the selfie!

I yield! I yield!

Take the selfie!

Okay. Morty, get in there

and say, "Cheese."

Morty?

Morty, come on!

God damn it!

Rick, don't get mad,

but I-I stole your portal gun.

What the [bleep] Morty?!

I told you I didn't want

the damn selfie 800 times!

Look, whatever the hell

is going on between you

and the president,

it's got nothing to do with me.

So where did you go?

I can't tell you.

Rick, did you tell my mom

she might be a clone?

No! I told her she wasn't!

Well, isn't that

what you'd tell a clone?

Oh, for Christ's sake.

Rick, my mom and dad

are getting back together.

What? No!

She's not a clone!

Well, she says it doesn't

matter if she is or isn't

because now she loves my dad,

and she wanted me

and Summer to come home,

and we're hiding from you

so you don't kill her

if she's a clone in a place

I picked that you will never find.

So don't look for us.

Come on, bitch!

Oh, you come on, bitch.

I'm out. I'm done.

I've got to...

I've got to go.

So I win. Then I'm in charge,

and you can't leave.

You're a terrorist.

You're an enemy of the state,

and you kicked me in the balls

10 minutes ago!

The office of the President

can't coexist

with a living god

that won't submit to it...

I mean, besides Poseidon.

But he's locked up

in Area 51 already,

so that doesn't really count.

Mr. President,

I'll make you a deal.

If you let me use

your ghetto-ass off-brand

deficit-tripling teleporter,

I can go take care of something,

and you'll never see me again.

Yes. Deal.

Invisi-troopers, stand down.

Yeah, yeah.

I don't want to hear it.

You know I could see them

this whole time, right?

Don't push it, Sanchez.

He found us!

I told you we shouldn't have gone

to the same cabin as last time!

Oh, we're not going anywhere.

This ends now.

Dad, if you're my dad.

Of course, you're not my dad.

You're here with a gun

because I am a clone.

I guess I have all

your daughter's memories.

So I guess I was her,

which makes me related to her.

But I don't relate to her.

She left her family and me,

which means I relate to them.

So if you kill me, fine.

You're not killing her.

But you're killing a real family.

And instead of doing that,

will you just go away?

Aren't there, like,

infinite time lines?

Can't you just move to one

where I don't know I'm a clone

and where a different

but identical version

of your authentic

sociopathic crazy bitch

of a daughter can keep

making you proud

by being somewhere else?

Beth, you crazy bitch.

You're my daughter.

I brought this here to kill Jerry.

Oh, my God!

Jesus Christ!

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

You win, Jerry. You win!

No amount of genius can stop

your dumb mediocre vacuous roots

from digging into everything

and everyone around you

and draining them of

any ability to fend you off.

Well, it couldn't have been

easy for you to say that.

I appreciate it.

Morty, where's my portal gun?

Let's get out of here.

I'm staying here, Rick.

Are you... Ugh!

Nobody gets it.

Nothing you think matters matters.

This isn't special.

This... This is happening

infinite times

across infinite realities.

Including this?

Yes!

Which is not to say that,

subjectively, it wasn't funny.

Are you going to stay?

There's infinite time lines, Morty.

Why would I stay in the one

where I trashed the White House,

became an enemy of America

and the lowest-status character

in my idiot family?

Because of the fart?

There's still some rubble

over there.

I don't think you've

ever understood

what "Secretary of the Interior"

means!

Hi, Mr. President.

I'm Rick Sanchez,

but not the one that did this.

We Ricks travel the infinite and

switch places with each other

like hermit crabs, I think.

I'm fly-fishing Rick.

You can distinguish me from the Rick

that you had a falling-out with

by my fly-fishing enthusiasm

and accompanying hat.

I hope I can be of service

if, uh, you ever find

the planet to be in danger.

Friends?

Sounds good to me.

Kids, dinner!

I got Panda Express!

Did you get sugar chicken?

That's kind of the only

thing they have.

I love Panda E!

Thanks, Mom!

I'm hoping to get a piece

of your sugar chicken later.

Stop it.

Here's your

stupid hat, dipshit.

Dad, you can't talk to

Jerry that way anymore.

We're a real family now.

In many ways, things

will be like season 1

but more streamlined.

Now Jerry and I are happily

married parents,

and the idea that I was motivated

by a fear of you leaving

can be eschewed.

Eschewed?

You've never used that word.

Maybe you are a clone.

It's not like

Rick would tell us.

♪

Ooh-wee!

What a season!

Sorry I never showed up,

but I got married.

I had a baby.

I went back to school

and got my G-E-E-E-D.

What did you do

while you were waiting?

Hopefully you didn't just [bleep]

around and waste your life.

Ooh-wee!

See you for Season 4 in,

like, a really long time!

I might even have

a big white Santa Claus beard

and... and... and a...

And a couple of grandkids

and all that kind of stuff.

See you... See you then!

Did you get any of that?
